Hello there, welcome to my site! My name is Manoj Dayaram, and I'm probably writing software for moovweb right now.
If you came here to find out what I like, well then, I like fire, fruit parfaits, hugs, tea, computer science education, pocket watches, puppies, kittens, ponies, top hats, monocles, half-belts, nail art, gloves, alpacas, grilled cheese, port, moscato, chartreuse, b&b, magic, and drawing. If you know I like something that's not on this list, then I probably either missed it, or I lied to you.
I will occasionally write random musings about life and such whenever I get the time or have a good idea. It's mostly brain dump for me, but perhaps it is of interest to you.
Unfortunately, there's not much else here, but if you'd like to find out more about me, you can always get in touch with me through other channels.
Still looking for more? Well, here's a picture of Beowulf ripping Grendel's arm off.
And that's that...
Most of the things I have are things people have given me throughout the years.  During the winter break, I’ve been trying to clean my room and I have stumbled through several items which I remember being a keepsake from someone, though I can’t quite remember from who or exactly the context that it was given to me in.

This made me wonder a few things…when does a keepsake stop being a keepsake?  Is it when it no longer reminds you of the person that gave it to you or the event where you stumbled upon it?  Or does it ever stop being one?  Does the item itself lose value as your memory of it’s beginnings fade?  Did it ever have any value other than it’s trigger to that memory?  If it’s a functional keepsake, does it lose all its value once it’s no longer functional?

People usually get the impression that I really like Halloween for some reason.  Not sure if it’s just because of my ridiculous nature or the random antics I pull from time to time that perhaps, when extrapolated, can be loosely related to the mischief which is associated with Halloween.  Regardless why it may be, when it comes close to Halloween time, friends always seem to have relatively high hopes and expectations in seeing what I’ll do, in terms of costume or anything event related.

It’s not really disappointment, but mostly a look of confusion that I get when I tell them that I’m actually not that into Halloween other than just really liking The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I don’t really like dressing in costume, and when you take that away, Halloween is mostly just a good reason to have fun in whatever way you want, which is what I try to do all the time anyways. 

However, this has been an exciting year of changes and revelations.  For this reason, I wanted to give Halloween a serious try.  I got super excited about our company party, but most importantly of all, I really wanted an awesome costume.

After a while of contemplating, and going through highs and lows of wanting a full body fox costume and realizing how hard it would be to find one my size, I was falling back into my old habit of “let me just wear my old rave clothes and call that a costume.”

I tried going back in my mind to previous Halloweens and thinking of any cool costumes I remembered.  Most I quickly brushed off assuming that they just wouldn’t work for me.  Finally, I remembered a costume my friend Dat had last year.  He was a Pinterest board - in other words, had several pictures pinned on his shirt.

I remember really liking his costume, but I didn’t quite understand why at the time, but it hit me now: interactivity.  It wasn’t just a costume you’d look at and admire, but rather, the viewer could participate.  They could add their own photo to his shirt.

I now had a new goal: an interactive costume.  I’d like to say that it took me a really long time to come up with the idea from here, but I was in a point in my life where this concept resonated with me so strongly that it came to me immediately: I would be a personification of Post Secret.

For those of you who don’t know what Post Secret is, it is “an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard” which are then posted on the website.  I was actually really surprise to find out how many people didn’t know about it, but it just made me that much happier to meet someone that got it right away.

So what does that mean in terms of a costume?  I decided to wear mostly black and carry fabric markers with me asking people to write their secrets or confessions onto my clothes.  I quickly bought some pants and a shirt from a thrift shop as well as suspenders and a tie.  I decided to use my fedora as a sign post to give people a clue as to what I was.  My costume was complete, or rather, more like "ready."

Since Halloween fell on a Thursday this year, there were parties and events going on both the weekend prior and the weekend after.  I decided to wear my costume on Friday and Saturday night on the prior week, as well as Thursday all day.  I walked around the streets, asking not just my friends and acquaintances, but strangers, baristas at coffee shops, waiters, drivers, and anyone that seemed even mildly interested if they’d like to post a secret on me.  Though sometimes impossible, I tried my best to keep the person’s identity anonymous to myself, and made sure to not survey what was written on me until the very end.

Though I really loved the idea of the costume, my expectations were very low.  You can’t really stop people from simply using you as a human blackboard where they’d write on me any nonsensical thing.  And though there was a fair share of people that drew penises or left their phone numbers, I was really impressed and touched at some of the secrets people left.

I’m afraid my demons will win.

Men have wounded me.  It’s scary.

Here is a couple written over each other:

For 3 years I had to fake it w/ my ex.

I’m having a good time.  It’s weird.

This one is hard to read, as it’s been overpowered by other messages on top of it, but it’s still somewhat decipherable if you look closely:

I make jokes b/c I have no reason to laugh.

I’m secretly a sad person.

And so many more…honestly, I started this project hoping to provide people a safe space for expressing things they have been holding on to, but I never realized the impact it would affect me.  Coming home at the end of the day on Halloween night and taking a look at some of the messages written on me, nearly all for the first time, actually made me tear up.  It was a true reminder that we’re all more than what we make ourselves seem.

Thank you to everyone who shared a secret with me.  I really appreciate you sharing a little vulnerable part of yourselves.

Today was the first day of Outside Lands.  Between all the stages, there was this one section in the middle of the woods called “Digital Detox: Disconnect to Reconnect.”  It was basically an area where they kindly asked you to turn off your phones and had a bunch of really cool old retro type of stuff.

There were rotary phones, chalkboards, crayons, board games, tea rooms…and a typewriter.  I’ve had “We Belong" stuck in my head recently, so I typed up a lyric from it on the top of an index card.  I then promptly folded it up and kept it in my wallet.

When I got home I found the card again while clearing out my pockets.  After looking at it for a while, I just couldn’t help the urge to illustrate it.  I actually spent quite a bit of time on this one, but I love how it turned out.  It’s probably one of my favorites.

My company came up with this new marketing term called a t.Engine.  The current logo is still a work in progress, but there was a joking consensus that it looked like a meat grinder.  Ike, the marketer who came up with the logo, challenged us to do better.

Thus, I present to you my rendition of a t.Engine!  In traditional start-up napkin canvas =D

Was waiting in the doctor’s office so I decided to put up a sketch.  Supposed to be a person sitting on a hill, overlooking the plains, large tree on the corner, tiny child flying a kite on the plains, mountains over the horizon.

The circle in the middle of the page was going to be a magnifying glass peeking into the world of a tiny ant, either carrying a leaf or walking along a blade of grass.  Unfortunately, I got called in before I could get started on that.

Me and Molly went to Dandelion Chocolate today.  The place has some pretty cool and intricate architecture.  This is my inaccurate representation of their roof from where I was sitting.

I’m not sure what happened here.  This is one of those drawings where I just tried drawing stuff out of no where.

I don’t like it.  Let’s forget it ever happened.

"I hadn’t been to a 7-11 for the longest time, and as I passed by one today on my way to work, I decided to stop by and check it out. I remember liking their coffee a lot, so I went straight to the coffee bar. As I poured myself a cup, the guy next to me accidentally spilled coffee everywhere.

He was a very stoic fellow. Very serious looking, expressionless. He wore a very interesting black hat.

Anyways, seeing the spill, I started helping him out. I took a bunch of napkins and gave him some. We both began cleaning vigorously. His expression unchanging the entire time. Not saying a word.

Once we were done he left to pay for his coffee. I still had to finish setting up mine, but as I walked to the cashier, she told me that the guy with the hat paid for my coffee. I quickly rushed out the door to look for him, but he was gone.

Thanks stoic hat guy, you made my day feel better!”

I was meaning to make a blog post about this but decided to write it as a story for sftruestoryproject.tumblr.com

I remember the coffee tasting terrible, but I couldn’t help but smile almost the entire day.  The little things truly have a huge impact.

But oh man, my handwriting…that’s pretty horrible.

Molly took over again with a really beautiful sketch of a shepherd girl.  As you can tell, her drawing style is very animeish.

So I got a Sketch Doodle kit from Yvonne which comes with a bunch of sketch doodle ideas.  The first one was “Aardvark.”  They show you the picture of a very cartoony aardvark and then have instructions on how you can draw it.  I really liked the inspiration since one of my biggest problems is just thinking of things to draw, but I didn’t like the instruction set on how to draw an aardvark, so I just went ahead and drew one from random pictures I found on the internet of real aardvarks.

I’m not too much of a fan on how it came out.  I finished drawing him and was disappointed.  Molly suggested I draw him play cards, so I gave him a hand of cards.  Then I thought it looked somewhat boring so I added a rabbit eating his cards, and the rabbit made me think of Alice in Wonderland and pocket watches, so I draw that with a secret Ace.

Overall a very random sketch.

We’re all imperfect.  That is not a surprise.  It’s something you hear everyone saying, “everyone has flaws, just gotta learn to accept them.”  Acceptance, it seems, is the way to deal with your imperfections.  You are imperfect  and that’s ok, so you should learn to accept your imperfections and be happy with yourself.

For the longest time, I had idolized this thought.  I took a close look at myself and pinned all the things I thought were terrible about me.  And what did I do?  I accepted them.  I took them in as part of me.  I joked about them, I talked about them freely, I let people know about them up front, I made them part of my personality.  I had ingrained my imperfections into myself so much so that my friends or colleagues didn’t even see them as such anymore, but rather, as just being me.

A great example of this is my sleeping habits.  I have terrible sleeping habits.  I go to sleep late, and wake up early.  When I do sleep, I sleep terribly, always waking up in the middle of the night, kicking, moving, whatever.  Every now and then I’ll get so terribly tired that I’ll crash and finally get a good night’s sleep, but I’ll be lucky to get those once a week.

So what did I do?  I owned it.  People are aware of my sleeping habits, I joke about it openly.  I’ve actually won the “Vampire” award at my company for being the most active during the night hours.  Whenever I go out I’m always willing to stay late because I know that if I came home, it’s not like I would be able to sleep, so might as well keep going.  Drink some tea or coffee at night? Sure, why not, it’s not like it would’ve made a difference either way.

After a while, not sleeping, as well as several other flaws/imperfections, felt like a part of me.  Or rather, I found myself thinking that what made me interesting as a person were my imperfections.  Perfect people are boring, I would think to myself.  I’m interesting and unique because of my flaws.  They became a topic of conversation, a way to engage people, or even an ice breaker.

All of a sudden I started idolizing my flaws.  I thought it was awesome that I couldn’t sleep, or rather, that I didn’t “need” sleep to function.  I stopped seeing it as a flaw and more as an attribute of what made me me.  I am the guy that rarely sleeps.  Isn’t that awesome?  It’s like a super power!  Insomniaman!

I tricked myself into making my flaws something positive.  It’s actually surprisingly easy to do.  I’m not indicisive, I just value the needs of others more and want their needs to be met.  I’m not terrible at time management, I just really care about my work and really want to get everything done.  

You can probably see how this can turn awry.

I very quickly became attached to my imperfections. I could try to improve any one of them, but that would be like giving up a part of myself.  What am I if not the bummed knee insomniac who would rather have someone else decide the music list for the night?  Who am I?  Will I still be an interesting person?  How could I be?

As you can tell, this lead to a mini identity crisis.  After much reflection, you kind of realize that the above is just not sustainable.  Sure, being purposely damaged and imperfect may offer me some level of allure to the general public, but compounded they’ve become a huge hazard for both my physical and mental health.  Not only that, but I almost felt childish, as in, I can’t believe that after all these years I still have these same problems. As my 13 year old self, I would’ve never fathom that my sleeping habits would’ve persisted over a decade later.  It felt embarrassing, as if I had made no progress in life.

From that revelation, the rest kind of just fell into place.  Our imperfections don’t make us who we are, they are transient attributes that will come and go throughout our life.  Holding to any particular one of them is selfish and preventing the real you from growing.

So I took a major turn, and for the past couple of years have been trying very hard to improve upon myself.  I’ve had some successes and also a lot of failures, but from anything you can derive useful information.  In the case of sleep, I read several books on the subject, tried several combinations of routines and even got a sleep-quality tracker.  After a while of experimenting, I finally found a routine that worked for me.  Though my sleeping habits are still quite in flux, I at least now know what to do in order to stabilze them when I really need to.  It’s unfortunately not always possible given everything else going on in my life, but I have at least made strides towards eventual sleep nirvana.

My attitude when speaking to people regarding my flaws has also changed.  If I speak about them at all, I’m no longer boastful, but rather, inquisitive for any advice they may have for trying to overcome them.

Do I miss being the damaged guy with imperfections?  Sometimes.  It’s hard to get rid of that feeling entirely, but I’m sure I’ll be at peace with it at some point.  I guess part of it is internalizing that, though someone that’s damaged may be interesting, someone who was able to overcome their damage is even more so.

Molly stole my sketchbook and drew her own little entry of a fairy.  As you can see, her drawing style far differs from mine, in the sense that hers is a lot better.  

We saw this beautiful sunset on the cruise, the horizon was flooded with really thick gray clouds, and you could barely see the sun just below it, on the horizon line, and slightly above.  The clouds had a sharp stop, leading up to a really gorgeous gradient sky.

My depiction is pretty terrible unfortunately.

Just swam with dolphins, so I drew one!  But, I didn’t like the way it turned out.  I didn’t want to erase it, so I just drew a cool looking octopus next to it.

He lost his two legs in the Great Ocean War.

I’m not sure what I was doing here.  I started off with a giant ball, and thought it would be funny to draw a dinosaur on it, so it was like, a dinosaur riding an asteroid, reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove.

But then I drew some guys playing ping pong with it, and…some crazy dude in the corner, I don’t know.  First experiment in mental drawing.

Raining Rainbow!

Me and Molly have been wanting to put up some paintings on our walls, so I recently bought a watercolor set and we started some practice paintings.  I drew/painted this jelly fish.  Could be better, but it’s a nice start.  Helped me learn a decent amount on how to control watercolor stuff.  Note to self, never try to color white on top of another color.

Went to Angel Island for a company trip.  One of my co-workers brought his 3 year old daughter.  I asked her what I I should draw, and she said a ballerina.  

I hate umbrellas.  Why do I hate them?  Well, they don’t shield you from rain coming in from an angle, they fail at shielding you from splashes coming from below, they poke people’s eyes out, they are completely useless in the wind, making you look ridiculous, and more often than not, end up getting destroyed after a rainy and windy day, making them a terrible solution for the problem they’re attempting to solve, which is not getting wet in the rain.

It’s easy to say that you like or dislike something if your reasonings are purely logical.  I like or dislike this because of reasons x, y z.  You make a logical argument in your brain as to why something is good or not and convince yourself of it.  It’s not important whether that argument is correct or not, what matters is that you are convinced that it is.

Can we really call liking, or disliking, as described above, an emotion?  Something that is construed from logical statements, as such, seems somewhat odd to call a feeling, yet most people use it in that manner.  I really like pocket watches.  I would go as far to say that I love pocket watches.  What do I love about them?  Well, it lets me check the time while I’m on my phone, they don’t constrict my wrist like a normal watch would, and I like the attention I get from people when they notice it.  You could delve further into the psychological implications of the last statement, but if you only really care about my emotional attachment to pocket watches, then the buck stops there.  

But why does the buck stop there?  Why do I like the attention people give me when they notice my pocket watch? — I’ve sat here for five minutes trying to think of a good reason and can’t come up with any.  At this point, I can very comfortably say that I like that feeling, simply because it is what I like, and that is that.  Again, you can delve into the topic psychologically, perhaps I didn’t get enough attention as a child and feel like I have to compensate, or I got too much and I need to keep up the rhythm.  However, at this stage, why I feel the way I feel is of no concern to me, but the fact that attention from people illicits that feeling is what matters.  That is true emotion, and everything else that leads up to it (such as the pocket watch itself) is merely a tool to get there.

So why do we like, or dislike certain things?  Why do we really like certain sounds, tastes, and feelings? Why do we like, or even love certain people?  Could you accurately describe the reasons why you like your significant other?

I’m no biochemist, but at this point, I feel like that is the domain we enter through.  For some reason or another, the stimuli that you adore or hate is causing some kind of chemical reaction to take place in your brain, perhaps your entire body.  Whatever reactions take place will dictate whether you feel good or bad about whatever just happened, and after enough times of it happening, you will develop some sense of like or dislike towards the given stimuli.*

So what does that say about our different likes and dislikes?  Is your love for chocolate equated to simply the chemicals that are released after you eat it?  Is your love for a person equated to simply the chemical reactions that take place in your brain when you’re around them?  One interesting thing that I’d like to propose is that regardless of what the equation is, you could almost always take the stimuli out of the picture and still be able to sustain the same feeling through other means.  In other words, it’s almost as if you have a choice of what you get to like and dislike as long as you are able to manipulate the chemical reactions happening in your brain, or at least trick your brain into thinking something is interesting enough times to develop a liking to it.

An obvious way of doing this would be through drugs.  Molly will very easily make you love everything and everyone.  A more sustainable approach, though, is consciously taking a deep interest in everything you encounter, and avoid dismissing things simply by what may seem as their boring surface.  I’m a firm believer that everything and everyone is interesting as long as you’re willing to dig deep into the people or subject matters.

So where does that leave us?  Suppose you do a pretty decent job at employing the above technique.  You become very open to new experiences without judgement, and have amassed a generally diverse collection of friends as you try your best not to dismiss anyone simply because they may seem uninteresting at first.  You become the person that’s always up for anything, no matter how ridiculous, and you always have a blast while doing things.

So what’s wrong with the picture above?  At first glance, nothing.  In fact, I’ve lived the majority of my life not seeing anything wrong with this picture.  The problem actually comes up when the technique is employed.  Rationally, you would only employ it when you’re doing things beyond your control, or perhaps if you’re trying new things voluntarily.  But what happens if that becomes your default way of thinking when experiencing new things and meeting new people?  Well, you pretty much end up liking everything you do, and everyone you meet.

Don’t see the problem yet?  The easiest way to bring it about is by asking a simple question:  What’s your favorite song?  Got an answer?  Then you probably don’t have this problem.  There’s just too many songs, and I like all of them.  Do you have a favorite restaurant?  They’re all great and delicious, I don’t know which one to pick.  This “disorder” of sorts surfaces up as simple indecisiveness, however, it can get slightly more complicated when you involve other people in the equation.  Do you like Amy?  Do you like her because of the technique you employed above, or do you truly like her?  Is there a difference?  Are you justified in dating Amy if you don’t like her any more than you like Becky, Carol, or any other girl for that matter?

If you become too comfortable with the technique, the problem also manifests itself when you’re given too much freedom.  So you have a long break coming up?  What are you going to do?  You could do absolutely anything.  What would you like to do?  I don’t know, there’s just too many things that are interesting, I can’t really choose.  So what happens?  You end up doing nothing.  You know that whatever you end up doing you’ll enjoy, so why bother doing anything?  

Perhaps the above may not seem like a problem to most people.  It’s actually a nice way to stay economical; you don’t have to spend money on any extravagant vacation plans or items.  Some might even say that it makes you easily amused, which in general, I consider to be a more positive characteristic than anything.  But it also means that you’re doing nothing, and thus, are making zero progress on anything.  Maybe that’s fine for some people, but for me, it makes me feel very uneasy.  

So what’s the solution then?  Just pick something and go?  But how do you know that you picked the “right” thing?  You like everything else just as much as whatever you picked, so how can you, in all good conscious, decide to do one thing over another?  Well, maybe you’ll just know.  Maybe there’s that one thing that’ll come around, say art, where you simply thoroughly enjoy.  You find yourself enthralled by it with little to no effort, and just like that, you found your niche.  But what if you haven’t found it yet?  Or worse, what if everything you’ve tried thus far gives you that feeling.  Then what?  What do you do?  Given infinite time, perhaps you could actually become involved in everything, but you don’t, so what do you save you’re precious time for?

Well, certainly not umbrellas, that’s for sure.

* Again, I’m not biochemist, so all of this is pure contemplation on my part.  I’d be totally excited about talking to a real biochemist about this though, so if you’re one, and you’d like to chat, drop me an email.


Was walking home from work where I decided to stop by a park and just chill for a bit.  There were a ton of birds flapping and chilling around, so I figured I’d give my hand at drawing one.  They all moved around way too much, so this sketch is the result of observing several different types of birds in several different positions.

On our flight to Vegas for EDC, figured I’d get a sketch in there.  Albert was sitting totally still reading his iPad for a decently long time.  In the middle of the sketch, he actually completely shifted and stretched all around…and then got right back into the same exact position, woot!

This is Daisy, one of Molly and Larry’s bearded dragons.  I started drawing her while she was laying on the log as depicted here, but then the bigger bearded dragon, Derek, pushed her off before I could finish my sketch, so I kind of improvised most of her body’s lower half.  Oh well, didn’t turn out terribly I suppose.

I’m going to Vegas on June 8th for EDC.  I was there last year and it was a lot of fun.  This year, I’m even meeting a few friends from high school that I haven’t seen in forever.  I’m pretty excited to catch up and party with them.

This is actually an anomaly.  I don’t usually travel for events like this.  I hate being on a plane, but concede that it is the best way to travel long distances.  I’m not much of a sight seer, and I hate tourism, crowded areas, and tourist attractions.  However, I find myself traveling a lot, specially to the East coast.  

So why do I travel then?  For me, it’s a very simple motivator:  To see people that I otherwise would not be able to see.  The dispersion of college and high school has helped me accumulate friends in many different places.  Unfortunately, I’m not that good in staying in touch by other means, such as email, Facebook, texts, and the like.  Thus, I opt for the more extreme approach, seeing them in person whenever I can.  From my lens, the sole purpose of going on a trip is to see one or more people and spend as much time as possible with them.  

One thing that I have noticed quite often is people’s desire to want to meet up at different locations.  Usually I’ll be casually talking about my future planned trips when people will chime in saying that our itineraries intersect, and that we should venture forth together into the night sky of a new city conquered by our ridiculosity.  

As much fun as the proposal sounds, I almost always reject the new venture.  What surprises me the most though is how hurt people seem to be by my rejection.  Almost as if it was a personal attack of me not enjoying their company even though I’m in the middle of doing just that.  Once I’m aware of how hurt people get, I find myself having to explain my motivations for travelling, and how I’d rather spend my limited time seeing the people that I don’t usually get to see.  Though my explanation helps provide reasoning behind my rejection, I can’t really do much about their disappointment.  

I understand where they’re coming from though.  Enjoying experiences with others in new locations is a great and easy way to cement relationships.  It puts you in a position where it’s “us against the world” which is hard not to bond over.  

So what is the best outcome in this situation?  I don’t want to lose the opportunity to create tighter bonds with the people I interact with daily, but I also would like to spend as much time as possible with the friends that I long to see. 

I’ve recently been thinking of trying a hybrid approach, were you perhaps join social groups and give a try at hanging out together.  My past attempts at this have failed as one side of the group quickly indulges in past nostalgia, neglecting the outsider and making him/her feel uncomfortable as they don’t know what people are talking about and also can’t contribute to the conversation.  

My hopeful solution for now is to simply be more attentive of the situation and try to make sure everyone is engaged and can contribute.  However, there’s still a lot that I need to learn about juggling these two sides.  What is the best outcome when combining these two situations?  Is everyone actually benefiting from this compromise?  Or am I merely cheating both sides from their respective time?

Well, you can tell you fail at life when you get a sketch-a-day notebook, decide that’s too hard so you relax the condition to sketch-a-week, and *still* can’t get that going….

Anyways, this one is a quick sketch I did of Karen while we were driving to/from/during Monterey.  I used my rainbow color pencil which is why all the colors are kind of blending with each other.

Tried to get a sketch in during Edwin’s birthday bash in Tahoe.  We did a wine tasting, so I started drawing the kitchen counter which had some left over glasses of wine.  Unfortunately, I got distracted with partying and I stopped half way.  By the time I came back to my drawing, someone had cleaned up the counter =(

Went to a dog park so I gave a try at drawing some of the dogs.  Unfortunately they moved way too fast, so I couldn’t get any good drawings in.  Alas, my memory, it fails me.

I was waiting at Starbucks for Lee to show up, so I decided to put on a sketch.  I really wanted to try my rainbow color pencil, and figured, what better subject to do that with than Rainbow Dash?  None, there’s no better subject.

Sketch-a-day #2, Homer, my ten year old puppy, laying down in what I can only imagine is the most awkward but comfortable position.

I’m starting a sketch-a-day journal.  It’s only been like four days and I already fell off the bandwagon with only two sketches, which is fine.  As long as I can go at least a sketch a week, I feel accomplished.

I drew this while I was bumming around in Central Park.  I looked around for things to draw and was feeling pretty meh about everything, so I started digging through the pictures on my phone and found this pic of James at Starbucks, and the rest is terrible drawing history.

Every now and then, I like to go to a barber to remind myself what a good old fashion shave feels like.  And every now and then, the barber tries to give me the closest shave possible.

Sometimes I warn the guy telling him that I have sensitive skin, so he should probably just shave with the grain. Other times, the barber figures this out himself and concedes the perfect shave in order to spare me bloodshed. 

However, sometimes the barber seems so confident that I think to myself, maybe this guy is good enough to not cut me on pursuit of a smooth face. Maybe this is the barber I’ve been looking for, maybe he’s the one who can save me from this eternal curse of a sandpaper chin. Certainly he has dealt with people like me before, he must already have everything worked out. Maybe I could learn I thing or two from him.

So I refrain, I refrain from saying anything, and let the pro do his job, me just sitting quietly with my eyes closed enjoying the hot towel on my face.

Invariable, it begins. 

"Shit" - not a word you want to hear from someone handling a sharp knife around your neck. "Fuck" "Shoot", it goes on, starting at my neck, through my chin, around my lips, everywhere. I feel every nick, every cut, perfectly synchronized with a curse. 

My reward? A face covered in blood. Alas, another dud. At least my face is super smooth…well, for today anyways.

Walking relatively fast towards the caltrain station, met a fellow fast paced walker. At first we kept pretty good pace with each other, but then we hit a barrier. A group of middle aged ladies came out of Whole Foods and walked slowly in front of us, they took up the entire sidewalk. Not being in a rush, I adjusted my pace accordingly, however, my fellow fast-pacer could not stand for such bottleneck.

It was funny seeing her trying to skip the group in front of us.  Methods such as diverting to the street and leaping them were met with new blocks from fire hydrants, trees, and cars.  After all her failed attempts, she just gave up and joined me at the back of the group at a slow pace.  

Once the group took a turn, we both got back into fast paced mode, but she gradually started slowing down, and I completely overtook her.  Goodbye fellow fast pacer, I hope you’re not late to wherever it is you’re going.  But if you just like walking fast like me, then I hope you enjoyed your walk =)

Survival of the Fittest
The Expressiveness of Computer Languages

I come from a very heavy Java background.  I’ve worked with Java for almost 10 years now, and I’ve worked with very large Java code bases in my previous jobs.  Needless to say, I was a huge design pattern nut.

For those of you who are not familiar, a design pattern is a generalized solution for a recurring problem within software engineering, mostly in the domain of source code organization and interactions.  The Gang of Four book is considered to be the bible of design patterns for Object Oriented Design, and it quickly became my obsession.  Whenever I encountered an architectural problem I couldn’t quite figure out how to solve (or even if I did figure out a solution, but wondered if there was a better one), that was the book I would turn to.

Design patterns ruled my coding life, and I aimed to understand as many as I could.  I love thinking about abstract problems.  I love thinking about software architecture: how different modules communicate with each other, how different parts of code interact with one another, and how to achieve maximum code clarity and self-documentation.  At the time, design patterns seemed like the best way to achieve that.

However, as time went on, and the more design patterns I encountered and implemented, something strange started happening…I started to hate coding.  I wasn’t exactly sure why, but for some reason I felt unfulfilled, aggravated, and frustrated whenever I actually needed to sit down and make something happen.  I still held my love for solving problems in an elegant fashion, figuring out the best way to organize modules in order to decrease coupling and increase code cohesion, however, I began to accept it as a fact that coding brilliant solutions was tedious and boring.  Not only that, I had began doubting whether all brilliant solutions could always be expressed in a clear self-documenting way in code.  Though design patterns offered a venue on how to organize code in such a way that modules were loosely coupled but cohesive, they actually left the source code looking klunky, confusing, and incomprehensible — unless you were already familiar with the design patterns used.

Though not as extensively as Java, I have worked with many other languages before.  At this point in my life I started yearning for the days when I used to work in SML due to how structured and clean my code had felt even though I was tackling rather complicated problems.  I missed my Functors, my Signatures and Modules, my Option Types and functions as first class citizens.  However, SML had always felt like a toy, mostly because of its grave performance, leaving its main purpose as an educational tool more so than anything else.

And such was life.  I eventually left my old job and found myself working here at Moovweb.  The language of choice?  Go.  Hmm, interesting, never heard of it.  It seemed like some weird chimera of Python and C with the concurrency constructs of SML.  Quite fascinating indeed, but it was just another language, nothing to get hyped over.  And so, I churned away and learned as much as I could about it as I began using it to code on my day to day.

As time went on, though, something interesting had happened…I started to enjoy coding again.  I actually found it fun to code solutions in Go.  It was ridiculously refreshing how easily the language allowed you to express complicated ideas.  It turned what once felt like a chore into a wonderful experience once again.  There was no boilerplate, no magic, no tricks; the code was always clear, self explanatory, concise, and clean.  That’s when it had dawned on me…

Design patterns exist to compensate for a programming language’s lack of expressiveness.

I remember feeling super proud of myself for coming up with this idea.  I walked around the halls with a huge smirk on my face, giving high fives to people, finger guns ablazing.

Little did I know that this revelation had been an item of much discussion for nearly ten years now within the Computer Science community.  Jeff Atwood from Coding Horror compiled a nice blog post about how design patterns might be how languages evolve back in 2005 where he quotes a wiki entry from Cunningham & Cunningham about how the presence of excessive design patterns is indicative of missing language features.

Though suddenly dulled of my triumph of coming up with something new and novel, I had at least gained a new confidence that the thought had merit and became increasingly interested in the idea of design patterns as language features.  As mentioned in Jeff Atwood’s post linked above, Peter Norvig had found that 16 of the 23 design patterns described in the Gang of Four book were invisible or simpler in the Lisp programming language.

But Lisp is a very old programming language.  If design patterns is indeed how languages evolve, then shouldn’t we have languages today that are way more expressive than Lisp?  Instead, languages such as C++ and Java came up and overtook the industry.   I guess like Darwinian evolution, we most certainly expect some unfavorable mutations to take place, we can only learn through experimentation and failure after all.

And boy do we experiment!  There are currently over 600 programming languages out there.  Some are mild variations of others, some are testing out completely new and different paradigms, and some are just good for a laugh…but why are languages such as Java and C++ still in such heavy use when it’s been shown that they lack expressiveness?  Shouldn’t they have been weeded out in the survival of the fittest, leaving only the most expressive languages around for common usage?

Well, in a world where novelty is appreciated, it seems more plausible that we would deal with certain inconveniences in order to say that we’re working with something novel.  Java and C++ were novel at the time they were created because Object Oriented Design was novel.  In fact, I would argue that most languages that gain any traction are languages that are based on a novel concept, a new paradigm, or a new attempt at applying expressiveness.

What does this mean for our evolution process?  Suddenly our definition of “fittest” is no longer how expressive a language is, but rather, how novel it is.  This would explain how platforms such as NodeJS are gaining traction, likewise Ruby’s reintroduction to popularity on the appearance of the novel Rails framework1.  After a while, the pattern becomes fairly clear:  When people start designing new programming languages or frameworks they’re not targeting expressiveness, they’re targeting novelty.

And that is why I love Go so much.  During its humble beginnings Go would get a lot of flak from the community because it didn’t introduce anything new or novel.  The language was “nothing special” people would say.  Rather than focusing on a new niche or novelty, the designers of the language focused on expressiveness, and it shows.  I was amazed at how an innocent-looking language feature such as embedding could be used to simplify a wealth of design patterns; Composite, Facade, Proxy, Bridge, and Adapter2.  Not only that, but channels, range, slices, and a wealth of other little language features come into your aid when implementing all sorts of different design patterns.  None of these features are new or novel, they’ve existed in many languages prior, yet you don’t usually see them all combined in one language with such synergy as they are in Go.

Go still adheres to the same laws of evolution as all its other language counterparts, but it’s betting that expressiveness (rather than novelty) should be used to define fitness.  It would’ve been a long shot a few years ago, but I think the Computer Science community is at a point where they’re ready for that change. As Go gains traction I hope that more debate centers around the concept of language expressiveness, hopefully leading to a world where the most expressive languages thrive.

So I didn't want to make it public until I got approval.
You guys never replied to my email ='(
I sent an email to social@moovweb asking for approval to do movie night :p
Not YOU :p
K, cool
I see I see
I'll send out an email :p
It's cool, I figured it would be a small crowd being so short notice
But it's a repetative thing.  I'll send out the details in the email.
Not tonight :p
Unless you can provide it
I brought my hard drive, but I don't think I have many horror movies.
I don't want to stream anything in our network
That's fine :p
Well, if possible, I'd rather people bring in a DVD/Blue ray/Hard drive for it :p
Yeah, that sounds good.
Let me send out the email
and then you can add a horror movie to the spreadsheet
on a day that you like.
Best dance ever, I'm going to pull that one off next time I go to a club.

we didn't do many logs :p
9x - 7i > 3(3x - 7u)
sure
so pro
Ooooh
I love that one :p
when you're done with that one, prove that there's an equal number of rational numbers between -1 and 1 than there are between infinity and negative infinity :p
You mean you've succeeded changing the world then? :p
That's a healthy dog
that makes so much more sense.
so deep
um
sure?
did yo umean 2^N < N!?
not if you're in a combinatorics class :p
2^x < x!   is truth.
well
x > 1
truth
ew, finance
proof?  by induction
(which is the same as magic)
I guess it's easier to prove 2^x <= x!
for x >= 1
oh, I'm silly, forgot about decimals
spent too much time in combinatorics land
where we only deal with integers
And that's why I'm the math minor, and Ben is the major :p
I used more greek letters in physics than I did in math

most beers are the worst beer ever
/me runs and hides

woops, that's not my terminal
considering I've only really drank beers in america and mexico, let's go with yes, that's what I meant : p
what's craft beer?  Like, home made?
never had home made beer
is that like moonshine?
I wanna try the apricot cider, that sounds exciting
I like sweetness
tangy is good too
don't like hoppy
hate hopes, which is what most beers indubitably taste like
spicy is meh
I don't like spicy stuff in general
that sounds terrifying
spicy = pain = masochistic
right....
so at some point in your life
you were like
let me hurt myself
as much as possible
so that at some point in the future
my taste buds will be numb from all pain.
Yes, but exercise has health benefits, eating spicyfood has no benefits other than eating more spicy food : p

This song just popped up in my pandora
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yteMugRAc0
Very appropriate
It's called "Nojs playlist"
every time I hear anything I like, I just add it to pandora
poor playlist will jump around from slipknot, billy joel, boomtown rats, bee gees, adele, simon and garfunkel, nine inch nails....poor pandora must think I'm schrizo.
schizo*
lately it's been playing a lot of electronica though
you forgot the maniacal laugh at the end.
I don't see why you would hire anyone but.

Six bullets of the Single Action Army Colt Revolver are said to be enough to kill anything that moves.
In the single action army?
It loads exactly six.
The one I linked?  not sure
/me only knows about Single Action Army Colts from the Metal Gear Solid video game series.
The Single Action Army Colt is a real gun.
Metal Gear Solid only used real guns in their games :p
I shot it at a shooting range actually
t'was nice.

@hcatlin I think that's the story of you and Hambot

Ok, we *will* have a function called "ship_it" which will write slash fiction about whatever scoped node you're on plus a given node :p
And we'll just forget about the other one.  I think this one will be more useful anyways.

I've checked the cookie jar, there were no fucks to be found.
I believe in a stateless internet
maybe we should write the bill of rights for the internet

my nose
I was eating my lunch

so you were just thinking mean thoughts, why such meanful thinking?

what's the difference between powerpop and pop rock?
sigh, so many references to the same music.
I don't like labeling music, most of the time labels are meaningless :p
fun meaningless arguments :p
um
the 70s maybe?
are we talking about decades only? or ten year spans?
what if I really liked 75-85?
hmm
most of the time
i have no idea when the music I listen to was composed
also
I'm sure the 14 and 15 hundreds had some good shit
As well as the 1700s and 1800s
anywho
look at the satisfying yet pointless arguments we're having about music release dates, almost as satisfying as music labels :p
btw, I post that in the platform room by mistake, true story bro.
i like the 90s
I grew up in the 90s
and the 00s
and now the 10s
I'm only vaguely aware of the tail end of the 80s
I think the requirement for a good karaoke song is that everyone knows it
in which case, it just needs to be popular :p

you have a puppy!
can we have an open puppy office?
yes
my shepherd/lab mix poops outside, but it took us like two months of training him.
if it was a real tree, I can see the confusion.
poor pup, so confused as to where to poop.
sure
I like the rat
:p
yes
can you pet them?
ooooh
unfortunately, I too am sick
I've pet all the animals
and I will again!
YES
wait
is a hedgehog the same thing?

ferrets are underrated in the coolness scale.
My friend had a husky/wolf hybrid in NJ, the thing was massive, but also adorable and loved to play wrestle.
Unfortunately, I am not hipster enough to pull off skinny jeans.  I will suffer through the ferret apocalypse.

was it because you were part of a group that built a booth/area?
that's awesome!
I love fire
I actually don't know much about burning man
I lot of the fire tricks I used to do ended up burning some of my hand/arm hair, which led to a not so pleasant smell
that's so cool
yeah :p
Excellent party trick:  pour some 151 on your hands, light your hand on fire, scare your friends :p
Put out before any permanent damage occurs
vodka doesn't light up as well
you can also just use isopropyl
Is this our new hazing ritual?
Nope, but now I am curious
that pictures confuses me

You can't do more than 50 pushups, GET OUT

also, these sound like very stereotypical interview questions : p

It's ok Shane, we still love you.
My most memorable scar was when I got bit by my neighbors dog
my biggest scar is probably my surgery scar

"not impressed"
that would be the ultimate win
hahaha
I vaguely recall that line
I saw that a while back.
good stuff
I don't get the cables =(
comcast already charges me out of the ass for internet only.
I got the cheapest thing they could offer me
maybe it has tv
I didn't really care
but we haven't hooked anything up to it
well, we might be moving out on March, so I'd rather deal with three months of expenses if we're just gonna install somewhere else
1channel.ch is awesome
I watched DJango in it yesterday

is it software, or a box that you hook up?

That's one ugly pic
FRESH milk!
oh, I forgot the best part
try this out:
fortune | tee >(say 2>/dev/null) | cowsay
if you're in a mac
if you're in linux, try this one:
fortune | tee >(espeak 2>/dev/null) | cowsay
yeah, that would probably be better
although, then you can't redirect it's output.  Not sure if the say command in mac has output, but espeak spits out a bunch of trash on stderr
Nice
unfortunately cowsay is in /usr/share/cowsay/cows in linux =(  Can't think of a good way to determine the location
which cowsay returns /usr/games/cowsay
my $COWPATH is empty =(
omg, that's brilliant
yeah, just change the ls line to "cowsay -l | wc -w"
so pro
and also change other stuff to make the rest of it work :p
heh
didn't even notice that :p
@brian https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
This is not a fortune one, this is just cowsay and espeak/say
But I also pick a random cow if you don't supply one :p
Actually, I was gonna change mine to just use a cow, and have a random flag
I'm adding you as an author :p
since I started off by stealing your code :p
oooh
is that not a standard cow?
I wonder what the process is to add a cow to the cowsay package
@brian put yours in github so I can link to it from mine :p
Donezo, Josh, you should add that to your github :p
We love giving to the community.
ah, nice, I actually just linked to a line number in your bashrc :p
Also, Josh, if you're not going to add these to a github, I'll have to make one to add them :p
Yes!
oh
can someone try out my script in a mac
I wanna make sure it works
https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
You need to give it an argument
cowspeak "hi there"
or via stdin
echo "hi there" | cowspeak
sweet
hahaha
nice
@JoshMorin did you make that repo with the cowfiles?
lol, you shouldn't include the standard ones :p  I would just add the ones josh made plus any extra ones you wanna make
Nice
I specially like the .DS_Store cowfile :p
I linked it from mine:  https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
Man, this is like, a plague, I'm gonna spend the rest of today working on cowspeak
Alrighty, gotta bounce, later guys, keep up the good cowwork
Yes, yes it does.

No, I prefer to use my memory for more useful endeavors.

True that.
working from work = blue bottle coffee

Looks delicious
Also
it's actually surprisingly hard to get an even coating on your face like that from a single head smash onto a cake
Yes, I've tried smashing many a friend's face onto cake, none turned out as good as that.
long edge cotton?
is it long edge though?
/me researched bed sheets, long edge matters
Should say on the packaging
Means the cotton is composed of longer strands, so they get tangled on eachother more securely, and don't pill in the wash.
well, I don't think they would make 1200 thread count that's not long edge...that seems rather silly.
but you'll find out if you get pills in your wash
I've had my bed sheet for three years
not a single pill
long edge cotton ftw
that is quite possible
I got 800 count sheets (don't remember if they were egyptian cotton or not), but they pilled after a couple of months...I was le sad

NIN is the only reason I'm going :p
as far as I remember, NIN stopped doing regular tours, Trent is putting all his efforts in How to Destroy Angels
I was supposed to go to a concert on 2010, but I missed it ='(
I just saw Life of Pi yesterday
he found a Lemur island
it was crazy

@all do you know if there's a way to buy ticketmaster tickets for someone else?
I already bought mine on a separate order, was gonna buy a ticket for someone else, but I think it just puts your name on it automatically
Hmmm, I guess I'll try that out.
here's another question...do the seat numbers and rows in an outsidelands ticket make a difference?  Like, if I'm going with someone, should I make sure I buy the tickets together?
that's what I thought
but the ticket I got has a row number and seat number
and I did not get a VIP
ok
yesm?

I remember Deb asked me a while back if there was anything she should put in the guys bathroom.
I told her that other than soap, paper towels, and toilet paper, I can't really imagine what else you'd want.

that would be nice

I guess it says it's audio on the title
maybe they'll release a real video later

Even so, it doesn't really strike me as single material, though it definitely has NIN feel
look at me, I've become all judgy about music :p

things like
how to prepare for burning man

what's up with all this kids suddenly making music videos?
kids, so privileged these days
back in my day
you had to work at a music studio for decades
as a janitor, singing to yourself
hoping that some random producer would discover you while walking the halls
Well, you don't want to lay all your eggs in one basket, so you also solve really complex math problems people write up on whiteboards
It's unclear if it's friendzone or not.
kids are weird

alpacas are the cutest thing ever
don't you EVER talk bad about alpacas
Freaking @Greg , I should've known it was you.

@liam you will die tonight
I have connections there
I don't need to.
@Greg it's one thing to push my buttons, but to brainwash @liam to do it...that is low.
That looks like a llama dude
FUCKING ADORABLE!
Alpaca, you can have adventures with me all the time!
Thank you @GregoryPinto
At least one good egg in the greg basket

The thieves are clearly smart enough to only commit crimes while I'm not in the office.
I was working from home
in the Russian Hill.
As you can see, miles away to be able to steal anything.
@Willow who was the culprit?
oh shit

I think that was me.

it's so clear
there was a fairmont fiasco

No one's ever sent me a pajamagram

that price tag is more heart attack inducing than the bacon we ate this morning.

I would play

@Tef it could've only been better if the night ended with us brawling somehow.

I tried to upload these pictures to my google plus album, and it crashed my browser

@Tef when is the next time you're visiting?
Moovweb Mixer #2! September edition!
The photobooth was a brilliant idea
I want photobooths in all future company events
fuck that, I want a photobooth in the office at all times

@ben link to private moovweb room
I don't want to deal with strangers
yeah
the interface is super confusing
I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to reorder songs on my queue
You'd think going to "organize playlist" would let you do it, but no
Yeah, the dragging doesn't work if you're in the "organize playlist" menu
I LOVE THAT SONG
WHO IS DJing RIGHT NOW?!
@SofiyaTaskova +100
unless you hate it
then you unawesome it
I GIVE YOU ANYTHING EVERYTHING I'LL GIVE YOU ONE THING
I have no idea
that's what I always thought it was, but I'm probably wrong :p  Yours makes more sense :p
It's the ending of the song...I remember I spliced this part out in my personal collection :p
nope
:p
/me is the outlier
@ben @heyliam is there any way to skip/fast forward through a song I'm playing?
is there a fast forward?
because this song has like
3 minutes of silence
and then another song
but the other song is sooooo good
oh wait
it's not silence
it's just giberrish ;P
actually
it's gonna be like 5 minutes of giberrish
lol
lesson learned
don't play 15 minute long songs in turntable
everyone will hate you
(shrug)
If you can find it all in one song
yes
here we go!
btw, this is the song I really wanted to play :p
wow
only person that likes my songs is ben
I feel so loved by ben but hated by everyone else :p
so what you're saying is that I should actually feel unloved by everyone

Now I'm stuck wearing super uncomfortable jeans all day and can't even work at marketing.  I'm le sad.
honestly, why do people wear jeans? it's like...the most uncomfortable thing ever
no, jeans are disgustingly uncomfortable
girl jeans don't count, they're made of a different stretchy material
zipper is definitely in the front
things are just very stiff, and the material is icky on my skin

@honorablemention that's the only reason I'm going.
nice
@all ...who's still at the office?
wrong sean
who'se z?
ah
you guys ordered food already, right?
wow
let's all calm down here
no worries
Thank you ben for being civilized, unlike some people.
it's cool, I was mia for a while
sorry hipchat didn't tell me that Z was you :p
indeed
although
@Z did take the peace treaty picture of me and Stucker on her first day
that was pretty legit.
high five.
I think so
first week at most
a few months
wow
there's a wonja
she just joined the room
I thought you guys were the only one sleft.
well
you did not say that.
I feel lied to.
oh shit
I guess I just don't know everyone's hipchat handles
/me fails at life.
there's a lot of hurt going around.
wild wonja uses sandstorm
wonja uses scratch
where did you guys order from?
lol
I wish pokemon would sometimes have tame monsters appear
"a tame wonja appears"
you can take over @w, no one else has it yet
although, nothing beats a three letter username
/me is super proud.
lol
1998 username which I still use today for many things: yedgyz
wow, you were webdeving back in 1988, that's legit
womb dev
omg
@wawnj  you have to make that your title
"yea, I'm a womb developer"
wonja web world
omg
I love Kuan's name
hmmm
omg
that's beautiful
I want a print of it
and hang it on my wall
indeed
have you guys seen the new hello kitty?
I have two now
I've had two for a while actually
no one visits me
(sad)
then I have to move all my things
too many things
who'se that?
man
where was his welcome email?
@HellYeahMyNameIsScarey you're the only one <3
alrighty, goodbye sir!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXmsLe8t_gg

yep yep
SEND IT!
Nooooooooooo
=(
I"m still in the office
I think I'm going to go home soon and play some resident evil 6 : p
heh
noice
laters
alrighty, I go
laters
what stock is that?
ah
Optimization ftw!
@SofiyaTaskova I had a bouncy ball, I don't sit on it anymore because it gave me RSI
or rather
I get worse RSI when sitting on the ball than I do compared to achair
Repetitive Stress Injury
on my wristies
I was so bouncy
I bounce all the times
I think it's related to the height of the desk
compared to the height of the ball
I need a bigger ball
or a lower desk
oh my
are we making a field trip?
lol
brilliant
codeine <3

@dave http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY
Hmmm
@Greg the takeout or the sitdown?
yes
me
/me wants
@Sassquatch solution:  always say it out loud
@Sassquatch solution #2: always say it three times.  Once to realize that you said it, again in your head, and then again out loud.
There's no expense is duplicate "aw yeah"ing
True, you still have to be conservative.
But conservativeness should give way to accuracy of execution.
In this case, actually executing "aw yeah" mentally and verbally.
anyways, BACK TO PAIR PROGRAMMING!
@honorablemention Hmmmmm, I don't ever remember having a game night
ah
yeah, long long ago
I think that was more impromptu
like
a bunch of people just stayed late to play video games and stuff :p
I had really bad RSI
and tried a bunch of shit
tried vertical mouse
and all kinds of wrist exercises
I found out that sitting on the ball was fucking my posture
as soon as I started sitting on a chair again, it felt a lot better (though not entirely gone)
also, less mouse and more keyboard shortcuts helps a lot.
at least it did for me.
*note, that's RSI on my right hand, forearm, and shoulder
I tried this one:  http://www.amazon.com/3M-Ergonomic-Optical-Compatible-EM500GPS/dp/B000F2BP7U
Hmmm
way too far ahead for me to say anything, but all things big wheel interest me.
but I wanna drive it!

In India we just call it chai
at home we just call it chai
green tea
black tea
chai
sometimes my parents will be like
do you want some ginger chai?
I don't know hindi, just words here or there
we speak a combination of english and spanish with random hindi vocab thrown in there
but ginger chai != ginger tea
in terms of what I expect my parents would make
if they told me they were making ginger chai
or ginger tea
ginger tea = boil water with ginger, maybe add some black tea
ginger chai = boil water with ginger, black tea, milk, honey, let it boil over X many times, serve.
hmm
don't know
Since "tea" in this case is most likely influenced by the British, they probably would just call it tea
Hindi has adopted a lot of english words.
i dunno, I call india india
@SofiyaTaskova not to sell chai tea? like....what?
I'm confuzzled by your statement
they can sell chai
well
is the chai in bulgaria distinctly different from the general "tea"
or if I walk up to a bulgarian shop and ask for a cup of chai, will they give me a very specific kind of tea?
yeah, so that's fine
I don't see the problem
oh
you're asking how do you ask for what americans think is chai tea in bulgaria?
@ben +100
I could use some chai right about now >.>
/me goes to get chai

the chai from the packets is always gross

if there's enough interest

judging me and my code
It makes every line you write take that much longer

truth
one of my friends already wrote "I love hentai" on my tie
I went to the office and Phil thought my costume had something to do with hentai
it made me sad
:p
depends
my friend is close enough that I find it semi-funny
if I stranger did that I would be somewhat upset
unless that was truly their secret
I was just at the new office
looks pretty cool
I had to run in there because I needed a mac charger
FYI, I stole someone's charger

I would be terrified of wearing them anywhere in fear of tearing/dirtying them.
hmm
nope

everyday
we can have a designated puppy play room
where lots of doggy toys reside
and all the puppies can socialize
what the building don't know, can't hurt it >.>
We can always have a moovweb picnic at a park

Yeah
I like this idea ^.^

I didn't know they revealed the answers at the end of it
It's a good place to learn though =D
specially having someone walk you through the answers
lots of learning
yep
I'm not that big of a fan of doing random puzzles
I believe the only reason I did the original stripe challenge was because I was interviewing at a company that asked me to do it as part of an interview :p

That's bazaar.
wait, this is immediately after installation?
That's odd
Hmm
Hmm
Let me try following the instructions myself and see what happens
also, is he running 32 bit?
Ok, that's it, the debian package is only for 64.
If he needs to use 32 bit, he needs to use the gem
That's the only package that has it.
Yup
k
cool
my pleasure.
What do you mean by "over the top"?
By didn't work, what exactly was the problem?
Yup, that should be fine.
Where/How did it error?
oh
no, that's correct
686 and 386
are both 32 bit
the debian package is 64 bit
amd64^
yup
We don't support 32 bit debian package officially
Well, the instructions page says that the debian package is for linux 64 bit at the top
We never advertised that we're supporting 32 bit.
ah
yeah
That would be good =)
I did
if the reporting fails, the sdk ignores it and keeps going
We've been reporting for the past couple of weeks, even though the handle hasn't been installed in apollo yet : p
We kick off a sole thread that reports to apollo
that thread blocks and waits for a response on our requests
but that thread blocking should not affect the rest of the sdk
yup
yep yep
k
Hmm
that seems like it's just for registering a mixer though
can I register a moovweb build with that same handle too?
oh, it looks like the old routes were removed in the latest build of apollo
we did, it looks like that was removed.
I guess we'd want to just add a new match rule for now, since the actual method hasn't changed.
Or should it be a separate method?
Do we have scheduled deploys? Or is it an on demand thing?
ok
Should I make an github issue for this?
k
Cool, thanks
excellent
In the mean time I'll just manually register them :p
Hmmm
That is a good question.
Theoretically, yes
But it hasn't been tested.
Yeah, the goal for windows is so that they'll be able to do that, unfortunately it's still very immature now.
I believe the policy is that we can provide them with an installer, but we warn them that it's beta
and could be buggy.
ok, yeah, I think that should be fine.
The windows installer is only for 4.0+
Hmm
Yeah, generate didn't work for any build, windows, linux, etc...
for 3.5 that is
generate was plugged in on 4.0
We could give them a pre-release of 4.0 that has generate in it.
@SeanJ would be the man to talk to about getting the prelease.
Yep :p
They're already messing around with a buggy windows build, whatever we give them can only be better than what they already have....theoretically.

@JoshMorin do you still need help on the asset-host stuff?  Feel free to ping me whenever you're back if you do.
@OJ Do you have a copy of the rewriter rules that you were using before? I'm trying to recreate your issue on a different project
@KevinLiou mstage.cox.com looks like is broken.
Did you recently push something to staging?
Carl?
That's old carl
used-to-work-here-but-not-anymore-carl
birds, what do they know
but i'll try
Have you tried cloning and push -f onto a different repo?
ah, ok
yeah, lemme take a look, that's kind of weird.
ok
Sorry it's taking me a while @BrianKendzior we were preocuppied with some other stuff earlier
still looking into this.
will let you know when I get somewhere
@BrianKendzior all fixed
Thank @ChrisMague
I see
I believe by default we do not cache anything through https
Hmm, at lunch right now, I can take a look when I get back
ah
@NickOwens if you remove the utf-8 from there, does it work?
Hmm, ok, I'll fix the generator.
@NickOwens not yet, need to talk to jef to find out why it was there in the first place
sure
mrmrm
give me a bit
ok, so what you're saying is that when you run moov server it forks all these processes and doesn't clean them up?
Have you tried doing the same thing with an older version of moov?  I feel like this might just be a go thing.
And it looks like the processes are defunct, so wouldn't the OS clean them up eventually?
@hari should be able to help, I'm at lunch
k
yeah, sorry, I don't have rep rights either
Sean or Hcat are the ones I know that have it.  Maybe Laurent as well?
magic
there's a component in apollo called the site analyzer
yeah, it's basically a crawler that starts crawling the page that your provide to the generate command
and it gets as many domains as it can, making sure to order them correctly if there are any redirects
yep
ooooor
I think there's an API for the analyzer
you might be able to hit it
lemme check
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
fyi
hrmm, hold on, the api call is there, but not sure how to hit it
yep, you should thank @MatB for setting it up ;)
Hmmmm.....I'd say let's avoid that for now, keep it internal
eventually we'll add a command to the SDK
that will spit it out nicely for you
heh
@JeffPatzer I would assume we'd just proxy over their robots.txt and they would have to have their own mobile rules there, no?
@AlexDeSimone what version of manhattan were you using?
yeah
you have to tell git to push the branch that you want
if you just push your local branch, it'll push that branch up to moovcloud
but that branch is not the one we compile
we only compile the master branch
so what you wanna say to git is
take my local "superbranch" and push it to the remote "master"
I think there's an article in our help docs on how to do it
http://help.moovweb.com/entries/21986091-can-i-push-a-branch-to-moovcloud
what do you mean?
you can always do a git push -f
that will completely wipe out the remote and put whatever you have locally there
Excellent
oh
what command did you use?
can you copy paste the git commadn?
hm
weird
have you tried without the -f?
oh
it's a tag
not sure if it works with tags
try making a new branch
with that tag
and doing that
cool
yeah, it's probably a git thing, you can't push tags to branches, makes sense
no, that's important
@SeanJ take a look at Brian's issue
I assigned it to @AaronLeung
Figured we'd want this for 4.1?
Ah, ok, that makes sense then, since they're immutable.  Then I guess we have to wait for 4.2 for this.
lemme try a quick example to see what happens for (a)
.....I was gonna use my local box :p
so this doesn't get caught by moov compile and causes an internal proxy error
soooo, we should maybe change the issue to cause an error on moov compile?
@AaronLeung @SeanJ for now we should maybe add an error at moov compile state?
the request dies, but mps is still alive
Response is a 500 with "Internal Server Error"
Thank Mr. @HariAnanth for that
I figured it should be enough to get you started on the plugins for sublime and textedit
if you still wanted to do that.
Sounds good =D
yep
sure
you should be able to use the config.json that's in that branch
nope, not needed
hmm
Well, as far as the sdk is concerned
these are the sites we're proxying
right, the idea is that it should be very explicit
legally, we know exactly what gets proxied
yup
the good thing though is that adding a new pod should be easy
and anyone with access to moovcloud could do it.
@sarah did you try moov login again?
Yeah, the auth token is set to expire every month
or something like that
then you have to reauth and it creates a new one (that should last somewhere around a month)
As long as it doesn't keep asking you for your username/password, it should be good.
Should've only asked you once
Yup, then it's normal.
yea, no worries
yup, np
np
sorry, don't know =(  Can anyone else help here? @all
okie dokes.
match($varname) { ... }
doesn't work?
weird
Hmmm
Is this an error on a new project, or an existing one?
I guess what I'm asking is whether it ever worked before, or it's never worked with this client
test.prefferredpremier.net gives me a 503
ah
and you said that proxying their normal desktop site is fine?
Hm, I suppose so
Is that different?
oh
the domains are different
Hmmm, Unfortunately, I'm not too sure, but my inclination is that their SSL certificate being self signed has something to do with it
if you browse to the test.preferredpremier.net you get a broken ssl cert warning by chrome
try this out:
moov server --verify-ssl-cert=false
and see if it works then.
@MeganHallberg Can you make a JIRA issue about it under the MoovSDK project?  It seems like it would be rather involved and I can't get into it now.
sure, np
yes, there is
v0.1 of it will just be a message that tells you you're using an out of date SDK
4.2 will have this, I forgot if 4.1 has this or not.
auto-upgrade will probably not be available until 4.3 or 4.4 though =(
@Aaron might be able to tell you what's wrong here
@Wonja if you go the the support room, someone can help you out there.
Hey Ted, are you in the SF office?
I can help you in person
oh, cool
excellent
epic stack traces?
You looking for some? I have plenty
I sees I sees
Yeah, try upgrading
4.2+
are you using compass or libsass?
nice
yeah, 4.0 had a lot of bugs in libsass
4.1 is a lot more stable with libsass
4.2 even more so
ha
yup
4.2.189 is what the cool kids use
oh
yes
that is true
I guess only super cool special kids use 4.2.189 :p
please
most stable release
v1
I think it's still in the gem server
so you can do
err
a "ruby" some would dare to say
@superkev try pushing your project, and then checking if the response is gzipped
you need to push first to flush the cache
but the change is made (at least for SVG
)
cool
same name in finalenv.json shoudl be the variable in tritium I think
hmm
yeah
@Pav was it an SSL request?
try running the server with the --verify-ssl=false flag
sounds like the upstream is using an SSL protocol that we don't support.
probably a really old version of SSL (maybe v1 or v2?)
Hmm, don't know for sure.  @ZhigangChen2 what versions of SSL do we support when connecting upstream?
np
@all we've figured out the problem, solution should be in pretty soon.
@ZhifengKoh the accepted way is for checking the presence of a "config.json" file for nosaka-based projects
or the presence for "scripts/main.ts" file for older projects
that should be fine too
yup
@cneale : @Gio is having some problems with pushing to moov cloud
@Gio can you describe the problem again in here?
github too?
sounds like some local voodoo
@cneale you around?
annnnnnnnywho.  If you deleted your key, then it makes sense that you can't pull/push from github, because github probably only had your older key uploaded
that should let you push/pull from github again
and if you run moov login, it should upload your key to our server, which should let you push/pull to our stuff.
cool, np
no worries, just wanted you to see the problem and solution so that you're aware of how to solve it next time
for github is to upload a new key, for us is to rerun moov login or also upload a new key
hmm, did it work (what I mentioned earlier)?
yeah
that's right
they should use moovguest
yep, I chat with him all the time :p
yup, all of them all the time
prolly means they're using an encryption method we don't support for HTTPS
I think we support TLS of all versions, but we don't support any of the SSL versions
Yeah, so you need to find out what encryption method they're using for https exactly
and the version
If you click on the padlock icon next to "https" in the browser URL, it should tell you (do this on the normal site, not the proxy)
I see
ok
so
I *think* we're planning on getting support for SSL 3.0 in 4.4
but as for what you can do now, well, before I say anything, I should talk to Zhigang and see what he's planning to do about it.
I can't seem to find him right now unfortunately.
shows up fine for me, tried it in a private browser session?
uhh, no idea =/
@Pav no, you keep using github for code versioning
the moovcloud repos are only for deployment
yup yup
yup
what's up, what happened?
I'm in the middle of a talk :p
and my phone buzzed
with all these hipchat messages
@hcatlin yeah, new mixer support is for 4.4, that hasn't rolled out yet
no cloud support yet.
you mean cookie scope?
I *think* that's available in the latest 1.0.* simple mobile
tritium.io should be updated with it
1.0.224
It's in the URL
Hmmm, then it's possible it hasn't been released yet (maybe only pre-released)
We do mixer releases alongside 4.4 releases, so tritium.io will be updated once that happens as well
need anything else?  I have 10 minutes before the next talk
I might drop by the office after it.
for a little bit
if it seems necessary.
@hcatlin
lol, okie dokes
laters
/me is surprised the internet was good enough to use hipchat
did moovweb work?
I just remembered that we need to update apollo to use the new name
@2Shanez did moovweb work?
ok, cool.
oh, you're using the script directly
ok, I'll make an issue in apollo to update the SDK rules
(so you can use 'moov genereate' instead)
alrighty, signing out again :p
never again
@JajaB jenkins3 shouldn't use up much space, if it does, we can probably clear a bunch
before you switch to EBS, lemme clean up the box
heh
k
that's weird
I thought they were soft linked to eachother, but it doesn't appear that way
ok
I see now
sorry, I'm a little off today
Could really use a moscato monday
heh, no moscato unfortunately, it's also not the same without ya
<3 jaja
weird
hmm
there's not that much extra cruft
I was surprised to find out the clibs were 455MB
but we need those to be there
yeah, I guess there's not much I can clean up
go for it
cool
k,
@JajaB looks good to me
admin is at a per bucket basis
you prolly have admin for the buckets you frequent
anyways, I commented your ticket like crazy, take looks :p
yup, looking
Interesting, have you tried it and it all looks good?
Cool
lemme test it out with the standard moov package, but looks like we shouldn't have any problems
Cool
Thanks @MatB and @cneale !
@GGTY no, not at all.  We don't even support the omni-mobile mixer anymore.
@DouglasDrouillard where does it stall?
during the process, or rather, what's the last line you see while it's stalling
Hmm
We're planning a sprint on speeding up the build process
A major part of it will be switching projects to use libsass instead of compass once libsass becomes more compliant
the other part of it will be optimizing the host checking.
And then there's all kinds of crazy other things we can do, but we still have to think of those
@LV stil no linux instructions =(
trust me, I tried :p
@HellYeahMyNameIsScarey that's a dup, I commented
no worries
original what?
ticket? I commented on the ones you guys did with the original ticket
Yeah, it should be in a comment on the one you guys opened
yup
lol
smallest learning curve of any programming language ever
omg, so pro
=(
?
oh
yeah, what do you want to do with it?
I know what you're talking about.
the machine that is
just log in, and run the vms that are there.
I can help mobilize...in 20 minutes
I can take a trip to wallgreens and buy balloons and stuff
woops, wrong window
ho hum
what mac version are you running?
and sdk version?
Hmm, oh, you need to build the clibs first if you haven't done that yet
weeeeird
did you perchance update your OS recently?  Or ran some kind of system updates?
Hmmm, try building the clibs again
still broken? hmm
hmmm
when are you gettting the libyaml error, on what step?
right, thats all of them
oh
weird
type uname -a in the terminal?
weird
so you have a 32 bit mac machine
Hmmm
I wonder if somewhere in the code we assume that mac builds are 64 bit...
although
make should detect that
how old is your laptop?
is it a powerpc?
or intel?
Hmm
ok
@superkev what version of Go are you usin?
k
and you mentioned that you could build before, but only recently you coudlnt'?
were you using the same go version then?
try using go1.0.3
What's the string trim thing error?
wait...did you used to use our gems before?
on that same laptop?
or the brew install?
yeah
and it worked fine, right?
and running it
weeeeeird
we only support 64 bit mac
but your mac claims to be 32 bit
yeah, it probably is 64 bits
but for some reason, it says it's 32
which doesn't make sense
hrmrmrm
can you try restarting it?  Not sure what that'll do, but something is definitely funky
@iceman is this right now?
can you show me the output of the console?
as well as the exact command you ran
oh, weird
if you do a moov generate on the command line it should be fine.
the page looks fine to me
Hmm, I was just able to generate a project through console, everything looked good.
ahh
@cneale (iseewhatyoudidthere)
Yeah, do what Chris said.
I believe it's it getting kicked out of the cache
lemme make sure of that
@LV yup, it's logged when a slug gets kicked out of the cache
@LV no, just tell him to try again
we had issues, I fixed them, they should be good now
@joshmorin plz try again, srykthnxbai
cool
@enahs le sad
well
one hamster
actually two, I'm in there :p
I haven't killed anything :p
I'm but a silent observer in the buildbox
I touch nothing, but tail -f everything
? for mens wearhouse?  I figure because shane tried to kick off another one?
wait
the latest one passed
v50 passed
should be good >.>
nooooooo
ok
now we wait again :p
504? when you watch it where?
You mean after clicking rebuild?
ah
file a bug
dude, 51 failed
someone kicked off 52?
I see
well
52 looks good
so
lets not touch it
the only slow part of the build was CDN :p
noice
it does two...weird
nother bug to file.
I'll file that one.
or maybe
I'll just comment on the one shane made
<3 bugs
hahaha
HIRED
Please do our QA job, kthnxbai
I will pay you in empanadas
only on mondays
I can do chicken if you really want to, I was gonna do cheese and onion ones
job well done
@enahs best qa
best qa (content)
what about it are you confused?
yeah, that's expected
oh wait
that's weird
you're looking at a different project:
you're hitting the project above
The CNAME's pointing to eachother is funky on their end, but at the end of the day, the cname points to our infra, and our infra does the correct thing
Is it DNS lesson time?
yep
our box ip
and that IP
can handle any project
which project it choses to handle
depends on the original host
as long as the IP is pointing to our infra
it doesn't matter
all clusters in our infra can handle any project
now
if they wanted to setup SSL
then they'd be fucked
SSL is a per box thing
so if they want SSL, we need to put their cert in a particular box, and then setup their CNAME to point to that box
in this case, it would break because their using the CNAME of a different project
rather than their own CNAME
questions?
Yeah, I saw it
will do that soon
it's been a busy mornin
morning*
holy freaking godly shit
(soawesome)
@JajaB should we do the same for slug syncing?  the PR was only for assets
Yeah, let's do it.
lemme see, how do I run the sync script if I only want to sync the single slug?
k, will add that bit
pretty decent, got cut in half
try one out
git pushes are pretty speedy now
yup yup!
Hmm
when did you push?
that doesn't work, it's just "moov version"
@hcatlin that doesn't help me :p
Hmm, so early this morning, around 8am
I see, but the project is normally deployed using libsass then?
weird
If you rebuilt already, the old logs are wiped
No, we only keep the most recent build
lol
no, it's fine...what exactly was the symptom though, I'm still unclear about that.
what was the actual error we were seeing?
ah
so it sounds like a caching issue
yeah, that's bazaar, it's possible that asset syncing might've failed the first time around?  I know Josh has changed the way we sync assets just yesterday
cool, we just pushed a fix
um
not sure yet
I need some input on that too
regarding the no-rewriter mixer
yeah
so
we'd need the customer to set an origin cname
so
www.josh.com would point to origin.josh.com
no
so
when we hit origin.josh.com
no rewriting will happen
Host header will still read "www.josh.com"
so the server running in origin.josh.com can create links accordingly (to www.josh.com)
our delta gregs has remained the same.
basically, yeah
yeah
there has to be something on the request that determines which project it belongs to
yeah, but then the real question is, how to set the cookie to begin with.
Yeah, I guess I'm worried about the MPS figuring out which project it is part :p
if multiple projects can be linked to a host...
I guess
there could be markers
we have to have a default project for a host
but then
the cookie overrides it
maybe a URL parameter also overrides it?
If we have those two things
we should be able to determine it
Hmmm, yeah, I think that's still up in the air
cool
thanks jaja
I'll update the script again
no guarantees
is a good policy to have :p
Hmm
@JajaB still around? not sure what the problem was...
also, why didn't hipchat email me about this -.-
ends this week
Friday is last day of the sprint
there's no correct sass gem
we've never locked it
so for every new release, we've always used the latest sass
for that particular release
If you're asking what version of the sass gem is running when you push a project
I can tell you that
sass 3.1.17
yeah
that's compass/sass for you
not much we can do there
if it's a new project, you can use libsass, it's much much faster
sadface
@JajaB was at CPR training, in now
what's up?
it's not updating slugs?
It's possible the slug daemon update thread might've died =/
Though I thought we took precautions to make sure that wouldn't happen
oh?
what did you do to fix it?
Hmm
lemme check
Yeah...
I'll make a ticket for it.
I do not understand what any of that means
:p
ah
lol
at this point it sounds like everything is game :p
omg
do it
I want to see it too!
wait
what's our legal bounds right now/
?
>.>
no
I refuse
to cheer up
jenkins has no gvm
I'm sad
lol
I guess we installed it manually on the other guys
last time
I don't think gvm was puppet controlled
:p
so how do you want to do this?
lol
looks like you were able to keep the same hostname?
oh, no
lol
if you were gonna make new hostnames
you could've named them something better :p
like
oh shit
wait
the linux node needs to be ubuntu 10.04 LTS
it's 12.04 right now =(
well
that is
if we want to support 10.04+, we need to build on 10.04
If we build for 12.04, we only support 12.04+
yeah, we dealt with this issue when we first set them up
It's why we couldn't build on the master node
and we had to use the slave which was older
Yeah, I think it's the version of the standard libraries that are linked when we compile our clibs
so when we compile our clibs on 12.04, it links to whatever version of the stdlib that 12.04 has
and that version doesn't exist in 10.04
but it's forwards compatible, so 10.04 versions are (soft linked) to the latest lib or something like that.
by the way
I heard that you taught the bot to handle points?
so if I say
@JajaB +1000
you haz 1000 points now?
=(
Maybe I'll make a bot that listens to the social room.
and just keeps track of points :p
anywho
before you break down the new jenkins box
lemme ask Sean and Hampton if we care about supporting 10.04
I mean
it's pretty old
12.04 is pretty old too, right? when did that come out?
yeah
so 10.03 is three years before 12.04
ah
neat
ah, so 12.04 is still the latest LTS
so there's probably a lot of people still running 10.04
=/
ok
yeah, sorry, it didn't even occur to me until after I saw the version in jenkins
yeah, but that just means that it doesn't get any more updates
people can still run it.
Hmm
we can talk about the benefits/etc..
I'm fine with using the latest
but we hsould document
such a negative nancy :p
anyways, I guess we can run a simple test
just to make sure I'm not full of shit
yeah, if we can do that, that's fine.
but yeah, the end use case is just being able to run our stuff in 10.04+
however we do that, I don't think anyone would care :p
also, @JajaB have you been looking at caesium, we're pretty close to finally running functions :p
nah, you can kill it
anyways, pair programming time
goodbye!
1.0.3 is the important one now
Hmm, lemme see
looks better ^.^
they're two different things I think
whenever a build comes in
we zip it up
and store it there
that's used for rollback deploys
yeah, that's what I said :p
but people said it was fine for now
Hmmm
it's been
probably a month?
you can delete anything that's not a zip file in there
I know there's some directories in there
you can delete those
just keep the ####.zip files
yeah....
it needs to be a proper file server
it came from that
yeah
i guess the ebs volume was for testing
not sure if we want to productize it now
It's a 1TB volume, so we have time
Talked to Laurent, he said there's still time to think about the proper solution, it's not just storage, but also how it will be maintained in the future, like, we should only be keeping the latest X builds for every project, not everything, so those parts should also be put into place before we decide how we'll store things.
cool :p
I removed a bunch of unused dirs
now it's only 14 GB ^.^
anyways, back to pairing!
I brought that same thing up!!!
I wanted to store things by directory
but they told me to forget that and just store it all in one dir as the build id -.-
GAH!
screw the name!
man*
>.> man, you need to be in more of these conversations so that I'm not the only one saying this stuff to people :p
-.-
alrighty, back to pair programming!
Hmm
not worried about building packages
but more so about building the clibs
and making sure their dependencies are appropriately met.
oh?
hmmm
is it like a virtual machine of sorts?
oooh
oh my
it's like you've taken my breadth away
installing it now, gonna play around with it.
hmmm
gonna have to learn how to use it...first time I ran the command it failed
ah, I need debootstrap adn devscripts
yeah
hmm
this is a lot to play around with for now...my head is not feeling great today, I'll try to look into it later though
yeah
seems simple enough, just got drowned in docks and got a headache while reading it
but no biggie, I'll look at it tomorrow
hahahha
also, yay @JajaB how does it work?
okie dokie
so it'll output that to the console?
also, what are the exit code statuses that I should worry about?
so keep the build going even if cache flush fails?
Hmmmm, fair enough
but shoudl probably log it somewhere?
gotcha
er
you mean edgecast?
yeah, we're doing that
right right
yup
we are
sweet
and....I should probably only flush the varnish caches after we upload and sync the new slug
lol
ok
oh yeah, the MPS cache
lol
I worked so hard
to tune down the build time
I refuse to add a sleep 15 :p
yeah, true
Yeah....
yeah
@JajaB what do you think about forking a process that sleeps 10 seconds and then runs the flush cache?
k
hmm
do you know how to guarantee that a subprocess I spawn in ruby does not get killed when the parent dies?
I guess I can do fork, I was hoping for a more elegant way :p
yeah, I guess I'll do fork, :p
yup yup, alrighty :p
cool
I'm still not done with the code :p
is that really bad?
k
lol
heheh
ha
I'm game for all production level logs that personally insult me.
oooh, link to ticket?
nice
that is the most adorable thing i've ever seen
woots
Figured it wouldn't hurt to have a another pair of eyes on this
cool, merging.
ready to check?
/me is about to push
ooh
ok
whaaaa
did it log an error (it should've)
of course
waits 10 seconds :p
should be roughly 10 seconds after the push is over since we do it at the very end
Hmm
hmm
but if it's getting flushed at all
it means that it's being called
weeeeeeird
maybe Process.detach changes the name of it?
hmm?
I see
so it might not be calling it after all
hmm
gah
blaaaaaah
blah
that means i need to make a shell script that wraps the logging and execute that from the fork
with nohup
I see
but that loses the logging
nope
Might wrap everything into a separate ruby script and execute that with nohup
Hmmmmm
We don't have the hostnames at that level
but yeah, I'll figure something out
I'd do it now, but we're heading to a Go meetup soon
Yup, no worries.
thanks!
will do
ooooh
that might be better ^.^
hahaha
alrighty, later
@Z I took a quick look at the sterlingjewlers project, it seems like everything is setup ok, but they don't have our IP address white listed, so when our servers try to hit them, we just time out
at least that's what my intuition is
why not?
oh wait
are you saying that the space is there?
oh
yeah
that's a fail
complain to the apollos
@cneale Shane has complaints for you.
I agree, we should check that the input for that is relatively close to a real domain.
supposed to copy to clipboard
yeah
I've complained about that too
holy shit
@GGTY is on fire
and yet, you're able to recall all these tickets.
<3 redbull zero
(content)
sounds like a bad idea
sounds like a worse idea
@MattMo for the absolutize_src ticket, did you want to use \z or \Z?
the ticket says \z, but I think \Z makes more sense?
\z and \Z are slightly different
so
/hi\Z/
will match
"hi"
and "hi\n"
/hi
sorry
/hi\z/
will only match "hi"
right, exactly
\z is end of string
so you have to be explicit
with the new line
so to match "hi\n"
with lower case z
you have to say
/hi\\n\z/
but capital Z let's you have a new line in there or not
or rather, it will match it with a new line or without
Hmm
Hmm, now that I think about it, lower case z might be more appropriate for this case
ok, well, @G3 replaced ^ adn $ with \A and \z
show meeeeee
ouchies
ok
we'll keep it at \z for now.
sorry
was investigating
hmm
HmmmI think that since it's a lowercase z, it would capture everything once as a whole
@MattMo http://rubular.com/r/lubNZloQKL
oh
so
if you don't have the "m" option
then it would not match at all
they do if you use lazy string match
Hrmrmr
or maybe not
what happened?
ew, tritium bug?
file ticket!
*goes back to making coffee*
Lemme benchmark it
Cool
weeeeee
@JajaB thanks
@JajaB wait, seriously?
I was planning on just using them as they were, you didn't have to do that!
But thanks!
lol
thanks
1.0 is the one we support
You can haz all the features!
(allthethings)
We output that info in the stats I think
Slug cache size
Yeah, prolly useage, I can double check when I'm back in the office
@SeanJ it was a mixer change, reassigned to Greg P, we've discussed the issues, new mixer will be released by today, including tests.
omg
I want to cry
is this a customer issue?
like, a live issue right now/
yes
Hm, what error are you seeing?
oh dear
that's not good
lemme investigate
k
@aparna the Mixer.lock file for that project is malformatted
it needs a space between the version and the name
Cool
np
?
if it's a rebuild, it doesn't show a commit hash
yup
eh
that's weird
looks like a brew bug
run brew update, hopefully it's fixed in a newer release
yeah
lol
I'll make the changes soon
evaluating...
@hcatlin code looks fine.  I like the initiative and drive that was necessary to code that.  I don't really care that much about the quality of hte code itself, but more so about the individual.
Good coding practices can always be taught to good people
I like the concept, he's basically doing part of what we did, the git deploy system, and then the server architecture
It is a little messy, pretty messy actually, but I assume all personal projects are messy
If you're working on something on your own, it'll always be messy
But it's really cool.  I approve on the coding regard.
@hcatlin something I would love to ask him is how he would feel about rewriting it from scratch.  What would he change, would he change anything? What would be better/worse
Oh? You mean like this beauty? https://github.com/mdayaram/gitsy
(allthethings)
Let's get that guy in here for an interview STAT
Give them everything they ask for!
Yeah
I agree
although
I like that you can run go source code without compiling it
using go run
obviously it compiles it on the fly
and then runs it
but have the command to do that is pretty neat
lol :p
what meeting?
wait, we're meeting about something?
(rdcry)
It's ok, I'll just cry myself in my new corner
what's it about?
maybe I should crash it
ahhh
I would crash, but I guess I'm too busy
btw
@JajaB did you know I'm leaving for nearly all of November?
@cneale
@cneale
@cneale
(catbug)
@all bye for most of November!
pictures will be taken if i don't forget to pack my camera!
@aparna yeah, the update is done =)
Thanks (content)
more is to come! hopefully the upcoming updates will go as seamlessly as this one >.>
oooh
I've seen some stuff in SFO regarding hello kitty
but not this particular one
they have a dress made of hello kitty-type plushes in sfo
ooh, I like the polaroid-like camera (content)
marcipan? Interesting
isn't that just like candy?
there's no way to get around the prompt other than setting the cookie
you can set the cookie under .moovapp.com, and that will work
you can do it from any website under moovapp
is the website that's hosting the iframe not under moovapp?
then clicking OK on the original prompt (the one that takes you to the main website should add the cookie under .moovapp.com
so the iframe should just work
is that not the case?
oh, sorry, I misread
Hmm, yeah, sorry, don't know what to tell you.  Only way to bypass the prompt is by having that cookie set
you could do...
in the config.json
have something like
hostmap: "mycompletely.differentsite.com => bar.com"
where mycompletely.differentsite.com is a domain that you own
and setup DNS for that
while the upstream is the site that you don't own
yeah
okie dokie, cool
cool
@MichaelCatlin can prolly help you with that
@bkendz @Cagri @enahs @iceman @aparna and anyone else I'm forgetting, the dev leads meeting is in dog path, it's the room next to what used to be Tarun's office
Oh my
so, should be correcting this
give me two minutes
@bkendz can you try now, 2.0.218 should be fine now
woot
