Hello there, welcome to my site! My name is Manoj Dayaram, and I'm probably writing software for moovweb right now.
If you came here to find out what I like, well then, I like fire, fruit parfaits, hugs, tea, computer science education, pocket watches, puppies, kittens, ponies, top hats, monocles, half-belts, nail art, gloves, alpacas, grilled cheese, port, moscato, chartreuse, b&b, magic, and drawing. If you know I like something that's not on this list, then I probably either missed it, or I lied to you.
I will occasionally write random musings about life and such whenever I get the time or have a good idea. It's mostly brain dump for me, but perhaps it is of interest to you.
Unfortunately, there's not much else here, but if you'd like to find out more about me, you can always get in touch with me through other channels.
Still looking for more? Well, here's a picture of Beowulf ripping Grendel's arm off.
And that's that...
Most of the things I have are things people have given me throughout the years.  During the winter break, I’ve been trying to clean my room and I have stumbled through several items which I remember being a keepsake from someone, though I can’t quite remember from who or exactly the context that it was given to me in.

This made me wonder a few things…when does a keepsake stop being a keepsake?  Is it when it no longer reminds you of the person that gave it to you or the event where you stumbled upon it?  Or does it ever stop being one?  Does the item itself lose value as your memory of it’s beginnings fade?  Did it ever have any value other than it’s trigger to that memory?  If it’s a functional keepsake, does it lose all its value once it’s no longer functional?

People usually get the impression that I really like Halloween for some reason.  Not sure if it’s just because of my ridiculous nature or the random antics I pull from time to time that perhaps, when extrapolated, can be loosely related to the mischief which is associated with Halloween.  Regardless why it may be, when it comes close to Halloween time, friends always seem to have relatively high hopes and expectations in seeing what I’ll do, in terms of costume or anything event related.

It’s not really disappointment, but mostly a look of confusion that I get when I tell them that I’m actually not that into Halloween other than just really liking The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I don’t really like dressing in costume, and when you take that away, Halloween is mostly just a good reason to have fun in whatever way you want, which is what I try to do all the time anyways. 

However, this has been an exciting year of changes and revelations.  For this reason, I wanted to give Halloween a serious try.  I got super excited about our company party, but most importantly of all, I really wanted an awesome costume.

After a while of contemplating, and going through highs and lows of wanting a full body fox costume and realizing how hard it would be to find one my size, I was falling back into my old habit of “let me just wear my old rave clothes and call that a costume.”

I tried going back in my mind to previous Halloweens and thinking of any cool costumes I remembered.  Most I quickly brushed off assuming that they just wouldn’t work for me.  Finally, I remembered a costume my friend Dat had last year.  He was a Pinterest board - in other words, had several pictures pinned on his shirt.

I remember really liking his costume, but I didn’t quite understand why at the time, but it hit me now: interactivity.  It wasn’t just a costume you’d look at and admire, but rather, the viewer could participate.  They could add their own photo to his shirt.

I now had a new goal: an interactive costume.  I’d like to say that it took me a really long time to come up with the idea from here, but I was in a point in my life where this concept resonated with me so strongly that it came to me immediately: I would be a personification of Post Secret.

For those of you who don’t know what Post Secret is, it is “an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard” which are then posted on the website.  I was actually really surprise to find out how many people didn’t know about it, but it just made me that much happier to meet someone that got it right away.

So what does that mean in terms of a costume?  I decided to wear mostly black and carry fabric markers with me asking people to write their secrets or confessions onto my clothes.  I quickly bought some pants and a shirt from a thrift shop as well as suspenders and a tie.  I decided to use my fedora as a sign post to give people a clue as to what I was.  My costume was complete, or rather, more like "ready."

Since Halloween fell on a Thursday this year, there were parties and events going on both the weekend prior and the weekend after.  I decided to wear my costume on Friday and Saturday night on the prior week, as well as Thursday all day.  I walked around the streets, asking not just my friends and acquaintances, but strangers, baristas at coffee shops, waiters, drivers, and anyone that seemed even mildly interested if they’d like to post a secret on me.  Though sometimes impossible, I tried my best to keep the person’s identity anonymous to myself, and made sure to not survey what was written on me until the very end.

Though I really loved the idea of the costume, my expectations were very low.  You can’t really stop people from simply using you as a human blackboard where they’d write on me any nonsensical thing.  And though there was a fair share of people that drew penises or left their phone numbers, I was really impressed and touched at some of the secrets people left.

I’m afraid my demons will win.

Men have wounded me.  It’s scary.

Here is a couple written over each other:

For 3 years I had to fake it w/ my ex.

I’m having a good time.  It’s weird.

This one is hard to read, as it’s been overpowered by other messages on top of it, but it’s still somewhat decipherable if you look closely:

I make jokes b/c I have no reason to laugh.

I’m secretly a sad person.

And so many more…honestly, I started this project hoping to provide people a safe space for expressing things they have been holding on to, but I never realized the impact it would affect me.  Coming home at the end of the day on Halloween night and taking a look at some of the messages written on me, nearly all for the first time, actually made me tear up.  It was a true reminder that we’re all more than what we make ourselves seem.

Thank you to everyone who shared a secret with me.  I really appreciate you sharing a little vulnerable part of yourselves.

Today was the first day of Outside Lands.  Between all the stages, there was this one section in the middle of the woods called “Digital Detox: Disconnect to Reconnect.”  It was basically an area where they kindly asked you to turn off your phones and had a bunch of really cool old retro type of stuff.

There were rotary phones, chalkboards, crayons, board games, tea rooms…and a typewriter.  I’ve had “We Belong" stuck in my head recently, so I typed up a lyric from it on the top of an index card.  I then promptly folded it up and kept it in my wallet.

When I got home I found the card again while clearing out my pockets.  After looking at it for a while, I just couldn’t help the urge to illustrate it.  I actually spent quite a bit of time on this one, but I love how it turned out.  It’s probably one of my favorites.

My company came up with this new marketing term called a t.Engine.  The current logo is still a work in progress, but there was a joking consensus that it looked like a meat grinder.  Ike, the marketer who came up with the logo, challenged us to do better.

Thus, I present to you my rendition of a t.Engine!  In traditional start-up napkin canvas =D

Was waiting in the doctor’s office so I decided to put up a sketch.  Supposed to be a person sitting on a hill, overlooking the plains, large tree on the corner, tiny child flying a kite on the plains, mountains over the horizon.

The circle in the middle of the page was going to be a magnifying glass peeking into the world of a tiny ant, either carrying a leaf or walking along a blade of grass.  Unfortunately, I got called in before I could get started on that.

Me and Molly went to Dandelion Chocolate today.  The place has some pretty cool and intricate architecture.  This is my inaccurate representation of their roof from where I was sitting.

I’m not sure what happened here.  This is one of those drawings where I just tried drawing stuff out of no where.

I don’t like it.  Let’s forget it ever happened.

"I hadn’t been to a 7-11 for the longest time, and as I passed by one today on my way to work, I decided to stop by and check it out. I remember liking their coffee a lot, so I went straight to the coffee bar. As I poured myself a cup, the guy next to me accidentally spilled coffee everywhere.

He was a very stoic fellow. Very serious looking, expressionless. He wore a very interesting black hat.

Anyways, seeing the spill, I started helping him out. I took a bunch of napkins and gave him some. We both began cleaning vigorously. His expression unchanging the entire time. Not saying a word.

Once we were done he left to pay for his coffee. I still had to finish setting up mine, but as I walked to the cashier, she told me that the guy with the hat paid for my coffee. I quickly rushed out the door to look for him, but he was gone.

Thanks stoic hat guy, you made my day feel better!”

I was meaning to make a blog post about this but decided to write it as a story for sftruestoryproject.tumblr.com

I remember the coffee tasting terrible, but I couldn’t help but smile almost the entire day.  The little things truly have a huge impact.

But oh man, my handwriting…that’s pretty horrible.

Molly took over again with a really beautiful sketch of a shepherd girl.  As you can tell, her drawing style is very animeish.

So I got a Sketch Doodle kit from Yvonne which comes with a bunch of sketch doodle ideas.  The first one was “Aardvark.”  They show you the picture of a very cartoony aardvark and then have instructions on how you can draw it.  I really liked the inspiration since one of my biggest problems is just thinking of things to draw, but I didn’t like the instruction set on how to draw an aardvark, so I just went ahead and drew one from random pictures I found on the internet of real aardvarks.

I’m not too much of a fan on how it came out.  I finished drawing him and was disappointed.  Molly suggested I draw him play cards, so I gave him a hand of cards.  Then I thought it looked somewhat boring so I added a rabbit eating his cards, and the rabbit made me think of Alice in Wonderland and pocket watches, so I draw that with a secret Ace.

Overall a very random sketch.

We’re all imperfect.  That is not a surprise.  It’s something you hear everyone saying, “everyone has flaws, just gotta learn to accept them.”  Acceptance, it seems, is the way to deal with your imperfections.  You are imperfect  and that’s ok, so you should learn to accept your imperfections and be happy with yourself.

For the longest time, I had idolized this thought.  I took a close look at myself and pinned all the things I thought were terrible about me.  And what did I do?  I accepted them.  I took them in as part of me.  I joked about them, I talked about them freely, I let people know about them up front, I made them part of my personality.  I had ingrained my imperfections into myself so much so that my friends or colleagues didn’t even see them as such anymore, but rather, as just being me.

A great example of this is my sleeping habits.  I have terrible sleeping habits.  I go to sleep late, and wake up early.  When I do sleep, I sleep terribly, always waking up in the middle of the night, kicking, moving, whatever.  Every now and then I’ll get so terribly tired that I’ll crash and finally get a good night’s sleep, but I’ll be lucky to get those once a week.

So what did I do?  I owned it.  People are aware of my sleeping habits, I joke about it openly.  I’ve actually won the “Vampire” award at my company for being the most active during the night hours.  Whenever I go out I’m always willing to stay late because I know that if I came home, it’s not like I would be able to sleep, so might as well keep going.  Drink some tea or coffee at night? Sure, why not, it’s not like it would’ve made a difference either way.

After a while, not sleeping, as well as several other flaws/imperfections, felt like a part of me.  Or rather, I found myself thinking that what made me interesting as a person were my imperfections.  Perfect people are boring, I would think to myself.  I’m interesting and unique because of my flaws.  They became a topic of conversation, a way to engage people, or even an ice breaker.

All of a sudden I started idolizing my flaws.  I thought it was awesome that I couldn’t sleep, or rather, that I didn’t “need” sleep to function.  I stopped seeing it as a flaw and more as an attribute of what made me me.  I am the guy that rarely sleeps.  Isn’t that awesome?  It’s like a super power!  Insomniaman!

I tricked myself into making my flaws something positive.  It’s actually surprisingly easy to do.  I’m not indicisive, I just value the needs of others more and want their needs to be met.  I’m not terrible at time management, I just really care about my work and really want to get everything done.  

You can probably see how this can turn awry.

I very quickly became attached to my imperfections. I could try to improve any one of them, but that would be like giving up a part of myself.  What am I if not the bummed knee insomniac who would rather have someone else decide the music list for the night?  Who am I?  Will I still be an interesting person?  How could I be?

As you can tell, this lead to a mini identity crisis.  After much reflection, you kind of realize that the above is just not sustainable.  Sure, being purposely damaged and imperfect may offer me some level of allure to the general public, but compounded they’ve become a huge hazard for both my physical and mental health.  Not only that, but I almost felt childish, as in, I can’t believe that after all these years I still have these same problems. As my 13 year old self, I would’ve never fathom that my sleeping habits would’ve persisted over a decade later.  It felt embarrassing, as if I had made no progress in life.

From that revelation, the rest kind of just fell into place.  Our imperfections don’t make us who we are, they are transient attributes that will come and go throughout our life.  Holding to any particular one of them is selfish and preventing the real you from growing.

So I took a major turn, and for the past couple of years have been trying very hard to improve upon myself.  I’ve had some successes and also a lot of failures, but from anything you can derive useful information.  In the case of sleep, I read several books on the subject, tried several combinations of routines and even got a sleep-quality tracker.  After a while of experimenting, I finally found a routine that worked for me.  Though my sleeping habits are still quite in flux, I at least now know what to do in order to stabilze them when I really need to.  It’s unfortunately not always possible given everything else going on in my life, but I have at least made strides towards eventual sleep nirvana.

My attitude when speaking to people regarding my flaws has also changed.  If I speak about them at all, I’m no longer boastful, but rather, inquisitive for any advice they may have for trying to overcome them.

Do I miss being the damaged guy with imperfections?  Sometimes.  It’s hard to get rid of that feeling entirely, but I’m sure I’ll be at peace with it at some point.  I guess part of it is internalizing that, though someone that’s damaged may be interesting, someone who was able to overcome their damage is even more so.

Molly stole my sketchbook and drew her own little entry of a fairy.  As you can see, her drawing style far differs from mine, in the sense that hers is a lot better.  

We saw this beautiful sunset on the cruise, the horizon was flooded with really thick gray clouds, and you could barely see the sun just below it, on the horizon line, and slightly above.  The clouds had a sharp stop, leading up to a really gorgeous gradient sky.

My depiction is pretty terrible unfortunately.

Just swam with dolphins, so I drew one!  But, I didn’t like the way it turned out.  I didn’t want to erase it, so I just drew a cool looking octopus next to it.

He lost his two legs in the Great Ocean War.

I’m not sure what I was doing here.  I started off with a giant ball, and thought it would be funny to draw a dinosaur on it, so it was like, a dinosaur riding an asteroid, reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove.

But then I drew some guys playing ping pong with it, and…some crazy dude in the corner, I don’t know.  First experiment in mental drawing.

Raining Rainbow!

Me and Molly have been wanting to put up some paintings on our walls, so I recently bought a watercolor set and we started some practice paintings.  I drew/painted this jelly fish.  Could be better, but it’s a nice start.  Helped me learn a decent amount on how to control watercolor stuff.  Note to self, never try to color white on top of another color.

Went to Angel Island for a company trip.  One of my co-workers brought his 3 year old daughter.  I asked her what I I should draw, and she said a ballerina.  

I hate umbrellas.  Why do I hate them?  Well, they don’t shield you from rain coming in from an angle, they fail at shielding you from splashes coming from below, they poke people’s eyes out, they are completely useless in the wind, making you look ridiculous, and more often than not, end up getting destroyed after a rainy and windy day, making them a terrible solution for the problem they’re attempting to solve, which is not getting wet in the rain.

It’s easy to say that you like or dislike something if your reasonings are purely logical.  I like or dislike this because of reasons x, y z.  You make a logical argument in your brain as to why something is good or not and convince yourself of it.  It’s not important whether that argument is correct or not, what matters is that you are convinced that it is.

Can we really call liking, or disliking, as described above, an emotion?  Something that is construed from logical statements, as such, seems somewhat odd to call a feeling, yet most people use it in that manner.  I really like pocket watches.  I would go as far to say that I love pocket watches.  What do I love about them?  Well, it lets me check the time while I’m on my phone, they don’t constrict my wrist like a normal watch would, and I like the attention I get from people when they notice it.  You could delve further into the psychological implications of the last statement, but if you only really care about my emotional attachment to pocket watches, then the buck stops there.  

But why does the buck stop there?  Why do I like the attention people give me when they notice my pocket watch? — I’ve sat here for five minutes trying to think of a good reason and can’t come up with any.  At this point, I can very comfortably say that I like that feeling, simply because it is what I like, and that is that.  Again, you can delve into the topic psychologically, perhaps I didn’t get enough attention as a child and feel like I have to compensate, or I got too much and I need to keep up the rhythm.  However, at this stage, why I feel the way I feel is of no concern to me, but the fact that attention from people illicits that feeling is what matters.  That is true emotion, and everything else that leads up to it (such as the pocket watch itself) is merely a tool to get there.

So why do we like, or dislike certain things?  Why do we really like certain sounds, tastes, and feelings? Why do we like, or even love certain people?  Could you accurately describe the reasons why you like your significant other?

I’m no biochemist, but at this point, I feel like that is the domain we enter through.  For some reason or another, the stimuli that you adore or hate is causing some kind of chemical reaction to take place in your brain, perhaps your entire body.  Whatever reactions take place will dictate whether you feel good or bad about whatever just happened, and after enough times of it happening, you will develop some sense of like or dislike towards the given stimuli.*

So what does that say about our different likes and dislikes?  Is your love for chocolate equated to simply the chemicals that are released after you eat it?  Is your love for a person equated to simply the chemical reactions that take place in your brain when you’re around them?  One interesting thing that I’d like to propose is that regardless of what the equation is, you could almost always take the stimuli out of the picture and still be able to sustain the same feeling through other means.  In other words, it’s almost as if you have a choice of what you get to like and dislike as long as you are able to manipulate the chemical reactions happening in your brain, or at least trick your brain into thinking something is interesting enough times to develop a liking to it.

An obvious way of doing this would be through drugs.  Molly will very easily make you love everything and everyone.  A more sustainable approach, though, is consciously taking a deep interest in everything you encounter, and avoid dismissing things simply by what may seem as their boring surface.  I’m a firm believer that everything and everyone is interesting as long as you’re willing to dig deep into the people or subject matters.

So where does that leave us?  Suppose you do a pretty decent job at employing the above technique.  You become very open to new experiences without judgement, and have amassed a generally diverse collection of friends as you try your best not to dismiss anyone simply because they may seem uninteresting at first.  You become the person that’s always up for anything, no matter how ridiculous, and you always have a blast while doing things.

So what’s wrong with the picture above?  At first glance, nothing.  In fact, I’ve lived the majority of my life not seeing anything wrong with this picture.  The problem actually comes up when the technique is employed.  Rationally, you would only employ it when you’re doing things beyond your control, or perhaps if you’re trying new things voluntarily.  But what happens if that becomes your default way of thinking when experiencing new things and meeting new people?  Well, you pretty much end up liking everything you do, and everyone you meet.

Don’t see the problem yet?  The easiest way to bring it about is by asking a simple question:  What’s your favorite song?  Got an answer?  Then you probably don’t have this problem.  There’s just too many songs, and I like all of them.  Do you have a favorite restaurant?  They’re all great and delicious, I don’t know which one to pick.  This “disorder” of sorts surfaces up as simple indecisiveness, however, it can get slightly more complicated when you involve other people in the equation.  Do you like Amy?  Do you like her because of the technique you employed above, or do you truly like her?  Is there a difference?  Are you justified in dating Amy if you don’t like her any more than you like Becky, Carol, or any other girl for that matter?

If you become too comfortable with the technique, the problem also manifests itself when you’re given too much freedom.  So you have a long break coming up?  What are you going to do?  You could do absolutely anything.  What would you like to do?  I don’t know, there’s just too many things that are interesting, I can’t really choose.  So what happens?  You end up doing nothing.  You know that whatever you end up doing you’ll enjoy, so why bother doing anything?  

Perhaps the above may not seem like a problem to most people.  It’s actually a nice way to stay economical; you don’t have to spend money on any extravagant vacation plans or items.  Some might even say that it makes you easily amused, which in general, I consider to be a more positive characteristic than anything.  But it also means that you’re doing nothing, and thus, are making zero progress on anything.  Maybe that’s fine for some people, but for me, it makes me feel very uneasy.  

So what’s the solution then?  Just pick something and go?  But how do you know that you picked the “right” thing?  You like everything else just as much as whatever you picked, so how can you, in all good conscious, decide to do one thing over another?  Well, maybe you’ll just know.  Maybe there’s that one thing that’ll come around, say art, where you simply thoroughly enjoy.  You find yourself enthralled by it with little to no effort, and just like that, you found your niche.  But what if you haven’t found it yet?  Or worse, what if everything you’ve tried thus far gives you that feeling.  Then what?  What do you do?  Given infinite time, perhaps you could actually become involved in everything, but you don’t, so what do you save you’re precious time for?

Well, certainly not umbrellas, that’s for sure.

* Again, I’m not biochemist, so all of this is pure contemplation on my part.  I’d be totally excited about talking to a real biochemist about this though, so if you’re one, and you’d like to chat, drop me an email.


Was walking home from work where I decided to stop by a park and just chill for a bit.  There were a ton of birds flapping and chilling around, so I figured I’d give my hand at drawing one.  They all moved around way too much, so this sketch is the result of observing several different types of birds in several different positions.

On our flight to Vegas for EDC, figured I’d get a sketch in there.  Albert was sitting totally still reading his iPad for a decently long time.  In the middle of the sketch, he actually completely shifted and stretched all around…and then got right back into the same exact position, woot!

This is Daisy, one of Molly and Larry’s bearded dragons.  I started drawing her while she was laying on the log as depicted here, but then the bigger bearded dragon, Derek, pushed her off before I could finish my sketch, so I kind of improvised most of her body’s lower half.  Oh well, didn’t turn out terribly I suppose.

I’m going to Vegas on June 8th for EDC.  I was there last year and it was a lot of fun.  This year, I’m even meeting a few friends from high school that I haven’t seen in forever.  I’m pretty excited to catch up and party with them.

This is actually an anomaly.  I don’t usually travel for events like this.  I hate being on a plane, but concede that it is the best way to travel long distances.  I’m not much of a sight seer, and I hate tourism, crowded areas, and tourist attractions.  However, I find myself traveling a lot, specially to the East coast.  

So why do I travel then?  For me, it’s a very simple motivator:  To see people that I otherwise would not be able to see.  The dispersion of college and high school has helped me accumulate friends in many different places.  Unfortunately, I’m not that good in staying in touch by other means, such as email, Facebook, texts, and the like.  Thus, I opt for the more extreme approach, seeing them in person whenever I can.  From my lens, the sole purpose of going on a trip is to see one or more people and spend as much time as possible with them.  

One thing that I have noticed quite often is people’s desire to want to meet up at different locations.  Usually I’ll be casually talking about my future planned trips when people will chime in saying that our itineraries intersect, and that we should venture forth together into the night sky of a new city conquered by our ridiculosity.  

As much fun as the proposal sounds, I almost always reject the new venture.  What surprises me the most though is how hurt people seem to be by my rejection.  Almost as if it was a personal attack of me not enjoying their company even though I’m in the middle of doing just that.  Once I’m aware of how hurt people get, I find myself having to explain my motivations for travelling, and how I’d rather spend my limited time seeing the people that I don’t usually get to see.  Though my explanation helps provide reasoning behind my rejection, I can’t really do much about their disappointment.  

I understand where they’re coming from though.  Enjoying experiences with others in new locations is a great and easy way to cement relationships.  It puts you in a position where it’s “us against the world” which is hard not to bond over.  

So what is the best outcome in this situation?  I don’t want to lose the opportunity to create tighter bonds with the people I interact with daily, but I also would like to spend as much time as possible with the friends that I long to see. 

I’ve recently been thinking of trying a hybrid approach, were you perhaps join social groups and give a try at hanging out together.  My past attempts at this have failed as one side of the group quickly indulges in past nostalgia, neglecting the outsider and making him/her feel uncomfortable as they don’t know what people are talking about and also can’t contribute to the conversation.  

My hopeful solution for now is to simply be more attentive of the situation and try to make sure everyone is engaged and can contribute.  However, there’s still a lot that I need to learn about juggling these two sides.  What is the best outcome when combining these two situations?  Is everyone actually benefiting from this compromise?  Or am I merely cheating both sides from their respective time?

Well, you can tell you fail at life when you get a sketch-a-day notebook, decide that’s too hard so you relax the condition to sketch-a-week, and *still* can’t get that going….

Anyways, this one is a quick sketch I did of Karen while we were driving to/from/during Monterey.  I used my rainbow color pencil which is why all the colors are kind of blending with each other.

Tried to get a sketch in during Edwin’s birthday bash in Tahoe.  We did a wine tasting, so I started drawing the kitchen counter which had some left over glasses of wine.  Unfortunately, I got distracted with partying and I stopped half way.  By the time I came back to my drawing, someone had cleaned up the counter =(

Went to a dog park so I gave a try at drawing some of the dogs.  Unfortunately they moved way too fast, so I couldn’t get any good drawings in.  Alas, my memory, it fails me.

I was waiting at Starbucks for Lee to show up, so I decided to put on a sketch.  I really wanted to try my rainbow color pencil, and figured, what better subject to do that with than Rainbow Dash?  None, there’s no better subject.

Sketch-a-day #2, Homer, my ten year old puppy, laying down in what I can only imagine is the most awkward but comfortable position.

I’m starting a sketch-a-day journal.  It’s only been like four days and I already fell off the bandwagon with only two sketches, which is fine.  As long as I can go at least a sketch a week, I feel accomplished.

I drew this while I was bumming around in Central Park.  I looked around for things to draw and was feeling pretty meh about everything, so I started digging through the pictures on my phone and found this pic of James at Starbucks, and the rest is terrible drawing history.

Every now and then, I like to go to a barber to remind myself what a good old fashion shave feels like.  And every now and then, the barber tries to give me the closest shave possible.

Sometimes I warn the guy telling him that I have sensitive skin, so he should probably just shave with the grain. Other times, the barber figures this out himself and concedes the perfect shave in order to spare me bloodshed. 

However, sometimes the barber seems so confident that I think to myself, maybe this guy is good enough to not cut me on pursuit of a smooth face. Maybe this is the barber I’ve been looking for, maybe he’s the one who can save me from this eternal curse of a sandpaper chin. Certainly he has dealt with people like me before, he must already have everything worked out. Maybe I could learn I thing or two from him.

So I refrain, I refrain from saying anything, and let the pro do his job, me just sitting quietly with my eyes closed enjoying the hot towel on my face.

Invariable, it begins. 

"Shit" - not a word you want to hear from someone handling a sharp knife around your neck. "Fuck" "Shoot", it goes on, starting at my neck, through my chin, around my lips, everywhere. I feel every nick, every cut, perfectly synchronized with a curse. 

My reward? A face covered in blood. Alas, another dud. At least my face is super smooth…well, for today anyways.

Walking relatively fast towards the caltrain station, met a fellow fast paced walker. At first we kept pretty good pace with each other, but then we hit a barrier. A group of middle aged ladies came out of Whole Foods and walked slowly in front of us, they took up the entire sidewalk. Not being in a rush, I adjusted my pace accordingly, however, my fellow fast-pacer could not stand for such bottleneck.

It was funny seeing her trying to skip the group in front of us.  Methods such as diverting to the street and leaping them were met with new blocks from fire hydrants, trees, and cars.  After all her failed attempts, she just gave up and joined me at the back of the group at a slow pace.  

Once the group took a turn, we both got back into fast paced mode, but she gradually started slowing down, and I completely overtook her.  Goodbye fellow fast pacer, I hope you’re not late to wherever it is you’re going.  But if you just like walking fast like me, then I hope you enjoyed your walk =)

Survival of the Fittest
The Expressiveness of Computer Languages

I come from a very heavy Java background.  I’ve worked with Java for almost 10 years now, and I’ve worked with very large Java code bases in my previous jobs.  Needless to say, I was a huge design pattern nut.

For those of you who are not familiar, a design pattern is a generalized solution for a recurring problem within software engineering, mostly in the domain of source code organization and interactions.  The Gang of Four book is considered to be the bible of design patterns for Object Oriented Design, and it quickly became my obsession.  Whenever I encountered an architectural problem I couldn’t quite figure out how to solve (or even if I did figure out a solution, but wondered if there was a better one), that was the book I would turn to.

Design patterns ruled my coding life, and I aimed to understand as many as I could.  I love thinking about abstract problems.  I love thinking about software architecture: how different modules communicate with each other, how different parts of code interact with one another, and how to achieve maximum code clarity and self-documentation.  At the time, design patterns seemed like the best way to achieve that.

However, as time went on, and the more design patterns I encountered and implemented, something strange started happening…I started to hate coding.  I wasn’t exactly sure why, but for some reason I felt unfulfilled, aggravated, and frustrated whenever I actually needed to sit down and make something happen.  I still held my love for solving problems in an elegant fashion, figuring out the best way to organize modules in order to decrease coupling and increase code cohesion, however, I began to accept it as a fact that coding brilliant solutions was tedious and boring.  Not only that, I had began doubting whether all brilliant solutions could always be expressed in a clear self-documenting way in code.  Though design patterns offered a venue on how to organize code in such a way that modules were loosely coupled but cohesive, they actually left the source code looking klunky, confusing, and incomprehensible — unless you were already familiar with the design patterns used.

Though not as extensively as Java, I have worked with many other languages before.  At this point in my life I started yearning for the days when I used to work in SML due to how structured and clean my code had felt even though I was tackling rather complicated problems.  I missed my Functors, my Signatures and Modules, my Option Types and functions as first class citizens.  However, SML had always felt like a toy, mostly because of its grave performance, leaving its main purpose as an educational tool more so than anything else.

And such was life.  I eventually left my old job and found myself working here at Moovweb.  The language of choice?  Go.  Hmm, interesting, never heard of it.  It seemed like some weird chimera of Python and C with the concurrency constructs of SML.  Quite fascinating indeed, but it was just another language, nothing to get hyped over.  And so, I churned away and learned as much as I could about it as I began using it to code on my day to day.

As time went on, though, something interesting had happened…I started to enjoy coding again.  I actually found it fun to code solutions in Go.  It was ridiculously refreshing how easily the language allowed you to express complicated ideas.  It turned what once felt like a chore into a wonderful experience once again.  There was no boilerplate, no magic, no tricks; the code was always clear, self explanatory, concise, and clean.  That’s when it had dawned on me…

Design patterns exist to compensate for a programming language’s lack of expressiveness.

I remember feeling super proud of myself for coming up with this idea.  I walked around the halls with a huge smirk on my face, giving high fives to people, finger guns ablazing.

Little did I know that this revelation had been an item of much discussion for nearly ten years now within the Computer Science community.  Jeff Atwood from Coding Horror compiled a nice blog post about how design patterns might be how languages evolve back in 2005 where he quotes a wiki entry from Cunningham & Cunningham about how the presence of excessive design patterns is indicative of missing language features.

Though suddenly dulled of my triumph of coming up with something new and novel, I had at least gained a new confidence that the thought had merit and became increasingly interested in the idea of design patterns as language features.  As mentioned in Jeff Atwood’s post linked above, Peter Norvig had found that 16 of the 23 design patterns described in the Gang of Four book were invisible or simpler in the Lisp programming language.

But Lisp is a very old programming language.  If design patterns is indeed how languages evolve, then shouldn’t we have languages today that are way more expressive than Lisp?  Instead, languages such as C++ and Java came up and overtook the industry.   I guess like Darwinian evolution, we most certainly expect some unfavorable mutations to take place, we can only learn through experimentation and failure after all.

And boy do we experiment!  There are currently over 600 programming languages out there.  Some are mild variations of others, some are testing out completely new and different paradigms, and some are just good for a laugh…but why are languages such as Java and C++ still in such heavy use when it’s been shown that they lack expressiveness?  Shouldn’t they have been weeded out in the survival of the fittest, leaving only the most expressive languages around for common usage?

Well, in a world where novelty is appreciated, it seems more plausible that we would deal with certain inconveniences in order to say that we’re working with something novel.  Java and C++ were novel at the time they were created because Object Oriented Design was novel.  In fact, I would argue that most languages that gain any traction are languages that are based on a novel concept, a new paradigm, or a new attempt at applying expressiveness.

What does this mean for our evolution process?  Suddenly our definition of “fittest” is no longer how expressive a language is, but rather, how novel it is.  This would explain how platforms such as NodeJS are gaining traction, likewise Ruby’s reintroduction to popularity on the appearance of the novel Rails framework1.  After a while, the pattern becomes fairly clear:  When people start designing new programming languages or frameworks they’re not targeting expressiveness, they’re targeting novelty.

And that is why I love Go so much.  During its humble beginnings Go would get a lot of flak from the community because it didn’t introduce anything new or novel.  The language was “nothing special” people would say.  Rather than focusing on a new niche or novelty, the designers of the language focused on expressiveness, and it shows.  I was amazed at how an innocent-looking language feature such as embedding could be used to simplify a wealth of design patterns; Composite, Facade, Proxy, Bridge, and Adapter2.  Not only that, but channels, range, slices, and a wealth of other little language features come into your aid when implementing all sorts of different design patterns.  None of these features are new or novel, they’ve existed in many languages prior, yet you don’t usually see them all combined in one language with such synergy as they are in Go.

Go still adheres to the same laws of evolution as all its other language counterparts, but it’s betting that expressiveness (rather than novelty) should be used to define fitness.  It would’ve been a long shot a few years ago, but I think the Computer Science community is at a point where they’re ready for that change. As Go gains traction I hope that more debate centers around the concept of language expressiveness, hopefully leading to a world where the most expressive languages thrive.

So I didn't want to make it public until I got approval.
You guys never replied to my email ='(
I sent an email to social@moovweb asking for approval to do movie night :p
Not YOU :p
K, cool
I see I see
I'll send out an email :p
It's cool, I figured it would be a small crowd being so short notice
But it's a repetative thing.  I'll send out the details in the email.
Not tonight :p
Unless you can provide it
I brought my hard drive, but I don't think I have many horror movies.
I don't want to stream anything in our network
That's fine :p
Well, if possible, I'd rather people bring in a DVD/Blue ray/Hard drive for it :p
Yeah, that sounds good.
Let me send out the email
and then you can add a horror movie to the spreadsheet
on a day that you like.
Best dance ever, I'm going to pull that one off next time I go to a club.

we didn't do many logs :p
9x - 7i > 3(3x - 7u)
sure
so pro
Ooooh
I love that one :p
when you're done with that one, prove that there's an equal number of rational numbers between -1 and 1 than there are between infinity and negative infinity :p
You mean you've succeeded changing the world then? :p
That's a healthy dog
that makes so much more sense.
so deep
um
sure?
did yo umean 2^N < N!?
not if you're in a combinatorics class :p
2^x < x!   is truth.
well
x > 1
truth
ew, finance
proof?  by induction
(which is the same as magic)
I guess it's easier to prove 2^x <= x!
for x >= 1
oh, I'm silly, forgot about decimals
spent too much time in combinatorics land
where we only deal with integers
And that's why I'm the math minor, and Ben is the major :p
I used more greek letters in physics than I did in math

most beers are the worst beer ever
/me runs and hides

woops, that's not my terminal
considering I've only really drank beers in america and mexico, let's go with yes, that's what I meant : p
what's craft beer?  Like, home made?
never had home made beer
is that like moonshine?
I wanna try the apricot cider, that sounds exciting
I like sweetness
tangy is good too
don't like hoppy
hate hopes, which is what most beers indubitably taste like
spicy is meh
I don't like spicy stuff in general
that sounds terrifying
spicy = pain = masochistic
right....
so at some point in your life
you were like
let me hurt myself
as much as possible
so that at some point in the future
my taste buds will be numb from all pain.
Yes, but exercise has health benefits, eating spicyfood has no benefits other than eating more spicy food : p

This song just popped up in my pandora
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yteMugRAc0
Very appropriate
It's called "Nojs playlist"
every time I hear anything I like, I just add it to pandora
poor playlist will jump around from slipknot, billy joel, boomtown rats, bee gees, adele, simon and garfunkel, nine inch nails....poor pandora must think I'm schrizo.
schizo*
lately it's been playing a lot of electronica though
you forgot the maniacal laugh at the end.
I don't see why you would hire anyone but.

Six bullets of the Single Action Army Colt Revolver are said to be enough to kill anything that moves.
In the single action army?
It loads exactly six.
The one I linked?  not sure
/me only knows about Single Action Army Colts from the Metal Gear Solid video game series.
The Single Action Army Colt is a real gun.
Metal Gear Solid only used real guns in their games :p
I shot it at a shooting range actually
t'was nice.

@hcatlin I think that's the story of you and Hambot

Ok, we *will* have a function called "ship_it" which will write slash fiction about whatever scoped node you're on plus a given node :p
And we'll just forget about the other one.  I think this one will be more useful anyways.

I've checked the cookie jar, there were no fucks to be found.
I believe in a stateless internet
maybe we should write the bill of rights for the internet

my nose
I was eating my lunch

so you were just thinking mean thoughts, why such meanful thinking?

what's the difference between powerpop and pop rock?
sigh, so many references to the same music.
I don't like labeling music, most of the time labels are meaningless :p
fun meaningless arguments :p
um
the 70s maybe?
are we talking about decades only? or ten year spans?
what if I really liked 75-85?
hmm
most of the time
i have no idea when the music I listen to was composed
also
I'm sure the 14 and 15 hundreds had some good shit
As well as the 1700s and 1800s
anywho
look at the satisfying yet pointless arguments we're having about music release dates, almost as satisfying as music labels :p
btw, I post that in the platform room by mistake, true story bro.
i like the 90s
I grew up in the 90s
and the 00s
and now the 10s
I'm only vaguely aware of the tail end of the 80s
I think the requirement for a good karaoke song is that everyone knows it
in which case, it just needs to be popular :p

you have a puppy!
can we have an open puppy office?
yes
my shepherd/lab mix poops outside, but it took us like two months of training him.
if it was a real tree, I can see the confusion.
poor pup, so confused as to where to poop.
sure
I like the rat
:p
yes
can you pet them?
ooooh
unfortunately, I too am sick
I've pet all the animals
and I will again!
YES
wait
is a hedgehog the same thing?

ferrets are underrated in the coolness scale.
My friend had a husky/wolf hybrid in NJ, the thing was massive, but also adorable and loved to play wrestle.
Unfortunately, I am not hipster enough to pull off skinny jeans.  I will suffer through the ferret apocalypse.

was it because you were part of a group that built a booth/area?
that's awesome!
I love fire
I actually don't know much about burning man
I lot of the fire tricks I used to do ended up burning some of my hand/arm hair, which led to a not so pleasant smell
that's so cool
yeah :p
Excellent party trick:  pour some 151 on your hands, light your hand on fire, scare your friends :p
Put out before any permanent damage occurs
vodka doesn't light up as well
you can also just use isopropyl
Is this our new hazing ritual?
Nope, but now I am curious
that pictures confuses me

You can't do more than 50 pushups, GET OUT

also, these sound like very stereotypical interview questions : p

It's ok Shane, we still love you.
My most memorable scar was when I got bit by my neighbors dog
my biggest scar is probably my surgery scar

"not impressed"
that would be the ultimate win
hahaha
I vaguely recall that line
I saw that a while back.
good stuff
I don't get the cables =(
comcast already charges me out of the ass for internet only.
I got the cheapest thing they could offer me
maybe it has tv
I didn't really care
but we haven't hooked anything up to it
well, we might be moving out on March, so I'd rather deal with three months of expenses if we're just gonna install somewhere else
1channel.ch is awesome
I watched DJango in it yesterday

is it software, or a box that you hook up?

That's one ugly pic
FRESH milk!
oh, I forgot the best part
try this out:
fortune | tee >(say 2>/dev/null) | cowsay
if you're in a mac
if you're in linux, try this one:
fortune | tee >(espeak 2>/dev/null) | cowsay
yeah, that would probably be better
although, then you can't redirect it's output.  Not sure if the say command in mac has output, but espeak spits out a bunch of trash on stderr
Nice
unfortunately cowsay is in /usr/share/cowsay/cows in linux =(  Can't think of a good way to determine the location
which cowsay returns /usr/games/cowsay
my $COWPATH is empty =(
omg, that's brilliant
yeah, just change the ls line to "cowsay -l | wc -w"
so pro
and also change other stuff to make the rest of it work :p
heh
didn't even notice that :p
@brian https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
This is not a fortune one, this is just cowsay and espeak/say
But I also pick a random cow if you don't supply one :p
Actually, I was gonna change mine to just use a cow, and have a random flag
I'm adding you as an author :p
since I started off by stealing your code :p
oooh
is that not a standard cow?
I wonder what the process is to add a cow to the cowsay package
@brian put yours in github so I can link to it from mine :p
Donezo, Josh, you should add that to your github :p
We love giving to the community.
ah, nice, I actually just linked to a line number in your bashrc :p
Also, Josh, if you're not going to add these to a github, I'll have to make one to add them :p
Yes!
oh
can someone try out my script in a mac
I wanna make sure it works
https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
You need to give it an argument
cowspeak "hi there"
or via stdin
echo "hi there" | cowspeak
sweet
hahaha
nice
@JoshMorin did you make that repo with the cowfiles?
lol, you shouldn't include the standard ones :p  I would just add the ones josh made plus any extra ones you wanna make
Nice
I specially like the .DS_Store cowfile :p
I linked it from mine:  https://github.com/mdayaram/cowspeak
Man, this is like, a plague, I'm gonna spend the rest of today working on cowspeak
Alrighty, gotta bounce, later guys, keep up the good cowwork
Yes, yes it does.

No, I prefer to use my memory for more useful endeavors.

True that.
working from work = blue bottle coffee

Looks delicious
Also
it's actually surprisingly hard to get an even coating on your face like that from a single head smash onto a cake
Yes, I've tried smashing many a friend's face onto cake, none turned out as good as that.
long edge cotton?
is it long edge though?
/me researched bed sheets, long edge matters
Should say on the packaging
Means the cotton is composed of longer strands, so they get tangled on eachother more securely, and don't pill in the wash.
well, I don't think they would make 1200 thread count that's not long edge...that seems rather silly.
but you'll find out if you get pills in your wash
I've had my bed sheet for three years
not a single pill
long edge cotton ftw
that is quite possible
I got 800 count sheets (don't remember if they were egyptian cotton or not), but they pilled after a couple of months...I was le sad

NIN is the only reason I'm going :p
as far as I remember, NIN stopped doing regular tours, Trent is putting all his efforts in How to Destroy Angels
I was supposed to go to a concert on 2010, but I missed it ='(
I just saw Life of Pi yesterday
he found a Lemur island
it was crazy

@all do you know if there's a way to buy ticketmaster tickets for someone else?
I already bought mine on a separate order, was gonna buy a ticket for someone else, but I think it just puts your name on it automatically
Hmmm, I guess I'll try that out.
here's another question...do the seat numbers and rows in an outsidelands ticket make a difference?  Like, if I'm going with someone, should I make sure I buy the tickets together?
that's what I thought
but the ticket I got has a row number and seat number
and I did not get a VIP
ok
yesm?

I remember Deb asked me a while back if there was anything she should put in the guys bathroom.
I told her that other than soap, paper towels, and toilet paper, I can't really imagine what else you'd want.

that would be nice

I guess it says it's audio on the title
maybe they'll release a real video later

Even so, it doesn't really strike me as single material, though it definitely has NIN feel
look at me, I've become all judgy about music :p

things like
how to prepare for burning man

what's up with all this kids suddenly making music videos?
kids, so privileged these days
back in my day
you had to work at a music studio for decades
as a janitor, singing to yourself
hoping that some random producer would discover you while walking the halls
Well, you don't want to lay all your eggs in one basket, so you also solve really complex math problems people write up on whiteboards
It's unclear if it's friendzone or not.
kids are weird

alpacas are the cutest thing ever
don't you EVER talk bad about alpacas
Freaking @Greg , I should've known it was you.

@liam you will die tonight
I have connections there
I don't need to.
@Greg it's one thing to push my buttons, but to brainwash @liam to do it...that is low.
That looks like a llama dude
FUCKING ADORABLE!
Alpaca, you can have adventures with me all the time!
Thank you @GregoryPinto
At least one good egg in the greg basket

The thieves are clearly smart enough to only commit crimes while I'm not in the office.
I was working from home
in the Russian Hill.
As you can see, miles away to be able to steal anything.
@Willow who was the culprit?
oh shit

I think that was me.

it's so clear
there was a fairmont fiasco

No one's ever sent me a pajamagram

that price tag is more heart attack inducing than the bacon we ate this morning.

I would play

@Tef it could've only been better if the night ended with us brawling somehow.

I tried to upload these pictures to my google plus album, and it crashed my browser

@Tef when is the next time you're visiting?
Moovweb Mixer #2! September edition!
The photobooth was a brilliant idea
I want photobooths in all future company events
fuck that, I want a photobooth in the office at all times

@ben link to private moovweb room
I don't want to deal with strangers
yeah
the interface is super confusing
I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to reorder songs on my queue
You'd think going to "organize playlist" would let you do it, but no
Yeah, the dragging doesn't work if you're in the "organize playlist" menu
I LOVE THAT SONG
WHO IS DJing RIGHT NOW?!
@SofiyaTaskova +100
unless you hate it
then you unawesome it
I GIVE YOU ANYTHING EVERYTHING I'LL GIVE YOU ONE THING
I have no idea
that's what I always thought it was, but I'm probably wrong :p  Yours makes more sense :p
It's the ending of the song...I remember I spliced this part out in my personal collection :p
nope
:p
/me is the outlier
@ben @heyliam is there any way to skip/fast forward through a song I'm playing?
is there a fast forward?
because this song has like
3 minutes of silence
and then another song
but the other song is sooooo good
oh wait
it's not silence
it's just giberrish ;P
actually
it's gonna be like 5 minutes of giberrish
lol
lesson learned
don't play 15 minute long songs in turntable
everyone will hate you
(shrug)
If you can find it all in one song
yes
here we go!
btw, this is the song I really wanted to play :p
wow
only person that likes my songs is ben
I feel so loved by ben but hated by everyone else :p
so what you're saying is that I should actually feel unloved by everyone

Now I'm stuck wearing super uncomfortable jeans all day and can't even work at marketing.  I'm le sad.
honestly, why do people wear jeans? it's like...the most uncomfortable thing ever
no, jeans are disgustingly uncomfortable
girl jeans don't count, they're made of a different stretchy material
zipper is definitely in the front
things are just very stiff, and the material is icky on my skin

@honorablemention that's the only reason I'm going.
nice
@all ...who's still at the office?
wrong sean
who'se z?
ah
you guys ordered food already, right?
wow
let's all calm down here
no worries
Thank you ben for being civilized, unlike some people.
it's cool, I was mia for a while
sorry hipchat didn't tell me that Z was you :p
indeed
although
@Z did take the peace treaty picture of me and Stucker on her first day
that was pretty legit.
high five.
I think so
first week at most
a few months
wow
there's a wonja
she just joined the room
I thought you guys were the only one sleft.
well
you did not say that.
I feel lied to.
oh shit
I guess I just don't know everyone's hipchat handles
/me fails at life.
there's a lot of hurt going around.
wild wonja uses sandstorm
wonja uses scratch
where did you guys order from?
lol
I wish pokemon would sometimes have tame monsters appear
"a tame wonja appears"
you can take over @w, no one else has it yet
although, nothing beats a three letter username
/me is super proud.
lol
1998 username which I still use today for many things: yedgyz
wow, you were webdeving back in 1988, that's legit
womb dev
omg
@wawnj  you have to make that your title
"yea, I'm a womb developer"
wonja web world
omg
I love Kuan's name
hmmm
omg
that's beautiful
I want a print of it
and hang it on my wall
indeed
have you guys seen the new hello kitty?
I have two now
I've had two for a while actually
no one visits me
(sad)
then I have to move all my things
too many things
who'se that?
man
where was his welcome email?
@HellYeahMyNameIsScarey you're the only one <3
alrighty, goodbye sir!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXmsLe8t_gg

yep yep
SEND IT!
Nooooooooooo
=(
I"m still in the office
I think I'm going to go home soon and play some resident evil 6 : p
heh
noice
laters
alrighty, I go
laters
what stock is that?
ah
Optimization ftw!
@SofiyaTaskova I had a bouncy ball, I don't sit on it anymore because it gave me RSI
or rather
I get worse RSI when sitting on the ball than I do compared to achair
Repetitive Stress Injury
on my wristies
I was so bouncy
I bounce all the times
I think it's related to the height of the desk
compared to the height of the ball
I need a bigger ball
or a lower desk
oh my
are we making a field trip?
lol
brilliant
codeine <3

@dave http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY
Hmmm
@Greg the takeout or the sitdown?
yes
me
/me wants
@Sassquatch solution:  always say it out loud
@Sassquatch solution #2: always say it three times.  Once to realize that you said it, again in your head, and then again out loud.
There's no expense is duplicate "aw yeah"ing
True, you still have to be conservative.
But conservativeness should give way to accuracy of execution.
In this case, actually executing "aw yeah" mentally and verbally.
anyways, BACK TO PAIR PROGRAMMING!
@honorablemention Hmmmmm, I don't ever remember having a game night
ah
yeah, long long ago
I think that was more impromptu
like
a bunch of people just stayed late to play video games and stuff :p
I had really bad RSI
and tried a bunch of shit
tried vertical mouse
and all kinds of wrist exercises
I found out that sitting on the ball was fucking my posture
as soon as I started sitting on a chair again, it felt a lot better (though not entirely gone)
also, less mouse and more keyboard shortcuts helps a lot.
at least it did for me.
*note, that's RSI on my right hand, forearm, and shoulder
I tried this one:  http://www.amazon.com/3M-Ergonomic-Optical-Compatible-EM500GPS/dp/B000F2BP7U
Hmmm
way too far ahead for me to say anything, but all things big wheel interest me.
but I wanna drive it!

In India we just call it chai
at home we just call it chai
green tea
black tea
chai
sometimes my parents will be like
do you want some ginger chai?
I don't know hindi, just words here or there
we speak a combination of english and spanish with random hindi vocab thrown in there
but ginger chai != ginger tea
in terms of what I expect my parents would make
if they told me they were making ginger chai
or ginger tea
ginger tea = boil water with ginger, maybe add some black tea
ginger chai = boil water with ginger, black tea, milk, honey, let it boil over X many times, serve.
hmm
don't know
Since "tea" in this case is most likely influenced by the British, they probably would just call it tea
Hindi has adopted a lot of english words.
i dunno, I call india india
@SofiyaTaskova not to sell chai tea? like....what?
I'm confuzzled by your statement
they can sell chai
well
is the chai in bulgaria distinctly different from the general "tea"
or if I walk up to a bulgarian shop and ask for a cup of chai, will they give me a very specific kind of tea?
yeah, so that's fine
I don't see the problem
oh
you're asking how do you ask for what americans think is chai tea in bulgaria?
@ben +100
I could use some chai right about now >.>
/me goes to get chai

the chai from the packets is always gross

if there's enough interest

judging me and my code
It makes every line you write take that much longer

truth
one of my friends already wrote "I love hentai" on my tie
I went to the office and Phil thought my costume had something to do with hentai
it made me sad
:p
depends
my friend is close enough that I find it semi-funny
if I stranger did that I would be somewhat upset
unless that was truly their secret
I was just at the new office
looks pretty cool
I had to run in there because I needed a mac charger
FYI, I stole someone's charger

I would be terrified of wearing them anywhere in fear of tearing/dirtying them.
hmm
nope

everyday
we can have a designated puppy play room
where lots of doggy toys reside
and all the puppies can socialize
what the building don't know, can't hurt it >.>
We can always have a moovweb picnic at a park

Yeah
I like this idea ^.^

I didn't know they revealed the answers at the end of it
It's a good place to learn though =D
specially having someone walk you through the answers
lots of learning
yep
I'm not that big of a fan of doing random puzzles
I believe the only reason I did the original stripe challenge was because I was interviewing at a company that asked me to do it as part of an interview :p

That's bazaar.
wait, this is immediately after installation?
That's odd
Hmm
Hmm
Let me try following the instructions myself and see what happens
also, is he running 32 bit?
Ok, that's it, the debian package is only for 64.
If he needs to use 32 bit, he needs to use the gem
That's the only package that has it.
Yup
k
cool
my pleasure.
What do you mean by "over the top"?
By didn't work, what exactly was the problem?
Yup, that should be fine.
Where/How did it error?
oh
no, that's correct
686 and 386
are both 32 bit
the debian package is 64 bit
amd64^
yup
We don't support 32 bit debian package officially
Well, the instructions page says that the debian package is for linux 64 bit at the top
We never advertised that we're supporting 32 bit.
ah
yeah
That would be good =)
I did
if the reporting fails, the sdk ignores it and keeps going
We've been reporting for the past couple of weeks, even though the handle hasn't been installed in apollo yet : p
We kick off a sole thread that reports to apollo
that thread blocks and waits for a response on our requests
but that thread blocking should not affect the rest of the sdk
yup
yep yep
k
Hmm
that seems like it's just for registering a mixer though
can I register a moovweb build with that same handle too?
oh, it looks like the old routes were removed in the latest build of apollo
we did, it looks like that was removed.
I guess we'd want to just add a new match rule for now, since the actual method hasn't changed.
Or should it be a separate method?
Do we have scheduled deploys? Or is it an on demand thing?
ok
Should I make an github issue for this?
k
Cool, thanks
excellent
In the mean time I'll just manually register them :p
Hmmm
That is a good question.
Theoretically, yes
But it hasn't been tested.
Yeah, the goal for windows is so that they'll be able to do that, unfortunately it's still very immature now.
I believe the policy is that we can provide them with an installer, but we warn them that it's beta
and could be buggy.
ok, yeah, I think that should be fine.
The windows installer is only for 4.0+
Hmm
Yeah, generate didn't work for any build, windows, linux, etc...
for 3.5 that is
generate was plugged in on 4.0
We could give them a pre-release of 4.0 that has generate in it.
@SeanJ would be the man to talk to about getting the prelease.
Yep :p
They're already messing around with a buggy windows build, whatever we give them can only be better than what they already have....theoretically.

@JoshMorin do you still need help on the asset-host stuff?  Feel free to ping me whenever you're back if you do.
@OJ Do you have a copy of the rewriter rules that you were using before? I'm trying to recreate your issue on a different project
@KevinLiou mstage.cox.com looks like is broken.
Did you recently push something to staging?
Carl?
That's old carl
used-to-work-here-but-not-anymore-carl
birds, what do they know
but i'll try
Have you tried cloning and push -f onto a different repo?
ah, ok
yeah, lemme take a look, that's kind of weird.
ok
Sorry it's taking me a while @BrianKendzior we were preocuppied with some other stuff earlier
still looking into this.
will let you know when I get somewhere
@BrianKendzior all fixed
Thank @ChrisMague
I see
I believe by default we do not cache anything through https
Hmm, at lunch right now, I can take a look when I get back
ah
@NickOwens if you remove the utf-8 from there, does it work?
Hmm, ok, I'll fix the generator.
@NickOwens not yet, need to talk to jef to find out why it was there in the first place
sure
mrmrm
give me a bit
ok, so what you're saying is that when you run moov server it forks all these processes and doesn't clean them up?
Have you tried doing the same thing with an older version of moov?  I feel like this might just be a go thing.
And it looks like the processes are defunct, so wouldn't the OS clean them up eventually?
@hari should be able to help, I'm at lunch
k
yeah, sorry, I don't have rep rights either
Sean or Hcat are the ones I know that have it.  Maybe Laurent as well?
magic
there's a component in apollo called the site analyzer
yeah, it's basically a crawler that starts crawling the page that your provide to the generate command
and it gets as many domains as it can, making sure to order them correctly if there are any redirects
yep
ooooor
I think there's an API for the analyzer
you might be able to hit it
lemme check
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
fyi
hrmm, hold on, the api call is there, but not sure how to hit it
yep, you should thank @MatB for setting it up ;)
Hmmmm.....I'd say let's avoid that for now, keep it internal
eventually we'll add a command to the SDK
that will spit it out nicely for you
heh
@JeffPatzer I would assume we'd just proxy over their robots.txt and they would have to have their own mobile rules there, no?
@AlexDeSimone what version of manhattan were you using?
yeah
you have to tell git to push the branch that you want
if you just push your local branch, it'll push that branch up to moovcloud
but that branch is not the one we compile
we only compile the master branch
so what you wanna say to git is
take my local "superbranch" and push it to the remote "master"
I think there's an article in our help docs on how to do it
http://help.moovweb.com/entries/21986091-can-i-push-a-branch-to-moovcloud
what do you mean?
you can always do a git push -f
that will completely wipe out the remote and put whatever you have locally there
Excellent
oh
what command did you use?
can you copy paste the git commadn?
hm
weird
have you tried without the -f?
oh
it's a tag
not sure if it works with tags
try making a new branch
with that tag
and doing that
cool
yeah, it's probably a git thing, you can't push tags to branches, makes sense
no, that's important
@SeanJ take a look at Brian's issue
I assigned it to @AaronLeung
Figured we'd want this for 4.1?
Ah, ok, that makes sense then, since they're immutable.  Then I guess we have to wait for 4.2 for this.
lemme try a quick example to see what happens for (a)
.....I was gonna use my local box :p
so this doesn't get caught by moov compile and causes an internal proxy error
soooo, we should maybe change the issue to cause an error on moov compile?
@AaronLeung @SeanJ for now we should maybe add an error at moov compile state?
the request dies, but mps is still alive
Response is a 500 with "Internal Server Error"
Thank Mr. @HariAnanth for that
I figured it should be enough to get you started on the plugins for sublime and textedit
if you still wanted to do that.
Sounds good =D
yep
sure
you should be able to use the config.json that's in that branch
nope, not needed
hmm
Well, as far as the sdk is concerned
these are the sites we're proxying
right, the idea is that it should be very explicit
legally, we know exactly what gets proxied
yup
the good thing though is that adding a new pod should be easy
and anyone with access to moovcloud could do it.
@sarah did you try moov login again?
Yeah, the auth token is set to expire every month
or something like that
then you have to reauth and it creates a new one (that should last somewhere around a month)
As long as it doesn't keep asking you for your username/password, it should be good.
Should've only asked you once
Yup, then it's normal.
yea, no worries
yup, np
np
sorry, don't know =(  Can anyone else help here? @all
okie dokes.
match($varname) { ... }
doesn't work?
weird
Hmmm
Is this an error on a new project, or an existing one?
I guess what I'm asking is whether it ever worked before, or it's never worked with this client
test.prefferredpremier.net gives me a 503
ah
and you said that proxying their normal desktop site is fine?
Hm, I suppose so
Is that different?
oh
the domains are different
Hmmm, Unfortunately, I'm not too sure, but my inclination is that their SSL certificate being self signed has something to do with it
if you browse to the test.preferredpremier.net you get a broken ssl cert warning by chrome
try this out:
moov server --verify-ssl-cert=false
and see if it works then.
@MeganHallberg Can you make a JIRA issue about it under the MoovSDK project?  It seems like it would be rather involved and I can't get into it now.
sure, np
yes, there is
v0.1 of it will just be a message that tells you you're using an out of date SDK
4.2 will have this, I forgot if 4.1 has this or not.
auto-upgrade will probably not be available until 4.3 or 4.4 though =(
@Aaron might be able to tell you what's wrong here
@Wonja if you go the the support room, someone can help you out there.
Hey Ted, are you in the SF office?
I can help you in person
oh, cool
excellent
epic stack traces?
You looking for some? I have plenty
I sees I sees
Yeah, try upgrading
4.2+
are you using compass or libsass?
nice
yeah, 4.0 had a lot of bugs in libsass
4.1 is a lot more stable with libsass
4.2 even more so
ha
yup
4.2.189 is what the cool kids use
oh
yes
that is true
I guess only super cool special kids use 4.2.189 :p
please
most stable release
v1
I think it's still in the gem server
so you can do
err
a "ruby" some would dare to say
@superkev try pushing your project, and then checking if the response is gzipped
you need to push first to flush the cache
but the change is made (at least for SVG
)
cool
same name in finalenv.json shoudl be the variable in tritium I think
hmm
yeah
@Pav was it an SSL request?
try running the server with the --verify-ssl=false flag
sounds like the upstream is using an SSL protocol that we don't support.
probably a really old version of SSL (maybe v1 or v2?)
Hmm, don't know for sure.  @ZhigangChen2 what versions of SSL do we support when connecting upstream?
np
@all we've figured out the problem, solution should be in pretty soon.
@ZhifengKoh the accepted way is for checking the presence of a "config.json" file for nosaka-based projects
or the presence for "scripts/main.ts" file for older projects
that should be fine too
yup
@cneale : @Gio is having some problems with pushing to moov cloud
@Gio can you describe the problem again in here?
github too?
sounds like some local voodoo
@cneale you around?
annnnnnnnywho.  If you deleted your key, then it makes sense that you can't pull/push from github, because github probably only had your older key uploaded
that should let you push/pull from github again
and if you run moov login, it should upload your key to our server, which should let you push/pull to our stuff.
cool, np
no worries, just wanted you to see the problem and solution so that you're aware of how to solve it next time
for github is to upload a new key, for us is to rerun moov login or also upload a new key
hmm, did it work (what I mentioned earlier)?
yeah
that's right
they should use moovguest
yep, I chat with him all the time :p
yup, all of them all the time
prolly means they're using an encryption method we don't support for HTTPS
I think we support TLS of all versions, but we don't support any of the SSL versions
Yeah, so you need to find out what encryption method they're using for https exactly
and the version
If you click on the padlock icon next to "https" in the browser URL, it should tell you (do this on the normal site, not the proxy)
I see
ok
so
I *think* we're planning on getting support for SSL 3.0 in 4.4
but as for what you can do now, well, before I say anything, I should talk to Zhigang and see what he's planning to do about it.
I can't seem to find him right now unfortunately.
shows up fine for me, tried it in a private browser session?
uhh, no idea =/
@Pav no, you keep using github for code versioning
the moovcloud repos are only for deployment
yup yup
yup
what's up, what happened?
I'm in the middle of a talk :p
and my phone buzzed
with all these hipchat messages
@hcatlin yeah, new mixer support is for 4.4, that hasn't rolled out yet
no cloud support yet.
you mean cookie scope?
I *think* that's available in the latest 1.0.* simple mobile
tritium.io should be updated with it
1.0.224
It's in the URL
Hmmm, then it's possible it hasn't been released yet (maybe only pre-released)
We do mixer releases alongside 4.4 releases, so tritium.io will be updated once that happens as well
need anything else?  I have 10 minutes before the next talk
I might drop by the office after it.
for a little bit
if it seems necessary.
@hcatlin
lol, okie dokes
laters
/me is surprised the internet was good enough to use hipchat
did moovweb work?
I just remembered that we need to update apollo to use the new name
@2Shanez did moovweb work?
ok, cool.
oh, you're using the script directly
ok, I'll make an issue in apollo to update the SDK rules
(so you can use 'moov genereate' instead)
alrighty, signing out again :p
never again
@JajaB jenkins3 shouldn't use up much space, if it does, we can probably clear a bunch
before you switch to EBS, lemme clean up the box
heh
k
that's weird
I thought they were soft linked to eachother, but it doesn't appear that way
ok
I see now
sorry, I'm a little off today
Could really use a moscato monday
heh, no moscato unfortunately, it's also not the same without ya
<3 jaja
weird
hmm
there's not that much extra cruft
I was surprised to find out the clibs were 455MB
but we need those to be there
yeah, I guess there's not much I can clean up
go for it
cool
k,
@JajaB looks good to me
admin is at a per bucket basis
you prolly have admin for the buckets you frequent
anyways, I commented your ticket like crazy, take looks :p
yup, looking
Interesting, have you tried it and it all looks good?
Cool
lemme test it out with the standard moov package, but looks like we shouldn't have any problems
Cool
Thanks @MatB and @cneale !
@GGTY no, not at all.  We don't even support the omni-mobile mixer anymore.
@DouglasDrouillard where does it stall?
during the process, or rather, what's the last line you see while it's stalling
Hmm
We're planning a sprint on speeding up the build process
A major part of it will be switching projects to use libsass instead of compass once libsass becomes more compliant
the other part of it will be optimizing the host checking.
And then there's all kinds of crazy other things we can do, but we still have to think of those
@LV stil no linux instructions =(
trust me, I tried :p
@HellYeahMyNameIsScarey that's a dup, I commented
no worries
original what?
ticket? I commented on the ones you guys did with the original ticket
Yeah, it should be in a comment on the one you guys opened
yup
lol
smallest learning curve of any programming language ever
omg, so pro
=(
?
oh
yeah, what do you want to do with it?
I know what you're talking about.
the machine that is
just log in, and run the vms that are there.
I can help mobilize...in 20 minutes
I can take a trip to wallgreens and buy balloons and stuff
woops, wrong window
ho hum
what mac version are you running?
and sdk version?
Hmm, oh, you need to build the clibs first if you haven't done that yet
weeeeird
did you perchance update your OS recently?  Or ran some kind of system updates?
Hmmm, try building the clibs again
still broken? hmm
hmmm
when are you gettting the libyaml error, on what step?
right, thats all of them
oh
weird
type uname -a in the terminal?
weird
so you have a 32 bit mac machine
Hmmm
I wonder if somewhere in the code we assume that mac builds are 64 bit...
although
make should detect that
how old is your laptop?
is it a powerpc?
or intel?
Hmm
ok
@superkev what version of Go are you usin?
k
and you mentioned that you could build before, but only recently you coudlnt'?
were you using the same go version then?
try using go1.0.3
What's the string trim thing error?
wait...did you used to use our gems before?
on that same laptop?
or the brew install?
yeah
and it worked fine, right?
and running it
weeeeeird
we only support 64 bit mac
but your mac claims to be 32 bit
yeah, it probably is 64 bits
but for some reason, it says it's 32
which doesn't make sense
hrmrmrm
can you try restarting it?  Not sure what that'll do, but something is definitely funky
@iceman is this right now?
can you show me the output of the console?
as well as the exact command you ran
oh, weird
if you do a moov generate on the command line it should be fine.
the page looks fine to me
Hmm, I was just able to generate a project through console, everything looked good.
ahh
@cneale (iseewhatyoudidthere)
Yeah, do what Chris said.
I believe it's it getting kicked out of the cache
lemme make sure of that
@LV yup, it's logged when a slug gets kicked out of the cache
@LV no, just tell him to try again
we had issues, I fixed them, they should be good now
@joshmorin plz try again, srykthnxbai
cool
@enahs le sad
well
one hamster
actually two, I'm in there :p
I haven't killed anything :p
I'm but a silent observer in the buildbox
I touch nothing, but tail -f everything
? for mens wearhouse?  I figure because shane tried to kick off another one?
wait
the latest one passed
v50 passed
should be good >.>
nooooooo
ok
now we wait again :p
504? when you watch it where?
You mean after clicking rebuild?
ah
file a bug
dude, 51 failed
someone kicked off 52?
I see
well
52 looks good
so
lets not touch it
the only slow part of the build was CDN :p
noice
it does two...weird
nother bug to file.
I'll file that one.
or maybe
I'll just comment on the one shane made
<3 bugs
hahaha
HIRED
Please do our QA job, kthnxbai
I will pay you in empanadas
only on mondays
I can do chicken if you really want to, I was gonna do cheese and onion ones
job well done
@enahs best qa
best qa (content)
what about it are you confused?
yeah, that's expected
oh wait
that's weird
you're looking at a different project:
you're hitting the project above
The CNAME's pointing to eachother is funky on their end, but at the end of the day, the cname points to our infra, and our infra does the correct thing
Is it DNS lesson time?
yep
our box ip
and that IP
can handle any project
which project it choses to handle
depends on the original host
as long as the IP is pointing to our infra
it doesn't matter
all clusters in our infra can handle any project
now
if they wanted to setup SSL
then they'd be fucked
SSL is a per box thing
so if they want SSL, we need to put their cert in a particular box, and then setup their CNAME to point to that box
in this case, it would break because their using the CNAME of a different project
rather than their own CNAME
questions?
Yeah, I saw it
will do that soon
it's been a busy mornin
morning*
holy freaking godly shit
(soawesome)
@JajaB should we do the same for slug syncing?  the PR was only for assets
Yeah, let's do it.
lemme see, how do I run the sync script if I only want to sync the single slug?
k, will add that bit
pretty decent, got cut in half
try one out
git pushes are pretty speedy now
yup yup!
Hmm
when did you push?
that doesn't work, it's just "moov version"
@hcatlin that doesn't help me :p
Hmm, so early this morning, around 8am
I see, but the project is normally deployed using libsass then?
weird
If you rebuilt already, the old logs are wiped
No, we only keep the most recent build
lol
no, it's fine...what exactly was the symptom though, I'm still unclear about that.
what was the actual error we were seeing?
ah
so it sounds like a caching issue
yeah, that's bazaar, it's possible that asset syncing might've failed the first time around?  I know Josh has changed the way we sync assets just yesterday
cool, we just pushed a fix
um
not sure yet
I need some input on that too
regarding the no-rewriter mixer
yeah
so
we'd need the customer to set an origin cname
so
www.josh.com would point to origin.josh.com
no
so
when we hit origin.josh.com
no rewriting will happen
Host header will still read "www.josh.com"
so the server running in origin.josh.com can create links accordingly (to www.josh.com)
our delta gregs has remained the same.
basically, yeah
yeah
there has to be something on the request that determines which project it belongs to
yeah, but then the real question is, how to set the cookie to begin with.
Yeah, I guess I'm worried about the MPS figuring out which project it is part :p
if multiple projects can be linked to a host...
I guess
there could be markers
we have to have a default project for a host
but then
the cookie overrides it
maybe a URL parameter also overrides it?
If we have those two things
we should be able to determine it
Hmmm, yeah, I think that's still up in the air
cool
thanks jaja
I'll update the script again
no guarantees
is a good policy to have :p
Hmm
@JajaB still around? not sure what the problem was...
also, why didn't hipchat email me about this -.-
ends this week
Friday is last day of the sprint
there's no correct sass gem
we've never locked it
so for every new release, we've always used the latest sass
for that particular release
If you're asking what version of the sass gem is running when you push a project
I can tell you that
sass 3.1.17
yeah
that's compass/sass for you
not much we can do there
if it's a new project, you can use libsass, it's much much faster
sadface
@JajaB was at CPR training, in now
what's up?
it's not updating slugs?
It's possible the slug daemon update thread might've died =/
Though I thought we took precautions to make sure that wouldn't happen
oh?
what did you do to fix it?
Hmm
lemme check
Yeah...
I'll make a ticket for it.
I do not understand what any of that means
:p
ah
lol
at this point it sounds like everything is game :p
omg
do it
I want to see it too!
wait
what's our legal bounds right now/
?
>.>
no
I refuse
to cheer up
jenkins has no gvm
I'm sad
lol
I guess we installed it manually on the other guys
last time
I don't think gvm was puppet controlled
:p
so how do you want to do this?
lol
looks like you were able to keep the same hostname?
oh, no
lol
if you were gonna make new hostnames
you could've named them something better :p
like
oh shit
wait
the linux node needs to be ubuntu 10.04 LTS
it's 12.04 right now =(
well
that is
if we want to support 10.04+, we need to build on 10.04
If we build for 12.04, we only support 12.04+
yeah, we dealt with this issue when we first set them up
It's why we couldn't build on the master node
and we had to use the slave which was older
Yeah, I think it's the version of the standard libraries that are linked when we compile our clibs
so when we compile our clibs on 12.04, it links to whatever version of the stdlib that 12.04 has
and that version doesn't exist in 10.04
but it's forwards compatible, so 10.04 versions are (soft linked) to the latest lib or something like that.
by the way
I heard that you taught the bot to handle points?
so if I say
@JajaB +1000
you haz 1000 points now?
=(
Maybe I'll make a bot that listens to the social room.
and just keeps track of points :p
anywho
before you break down the new jenkins box
lemme ask Sean and Hampton if we care about supporting 10.04
I mean
it's pretty old
12.04 is pretty old too, right? when did that come out?
yeah
so 10.03 is three years before 12.04
ah
neat
ah, so 12.04 is still the latest LTS
so there's probably a lot of people still running 10.04
=/
ok
yeah, sorry, it didn't even occur to me until after I saw the version in jenkins
yeah, but that just means that it doesn't get any more updates
people can still run it.
Hmm
we can talk about the benefits/etc..
I'm fine with using the latest
but we hsould document
such a negative nancy :p
anyways, I guess we can run a simple test
just to make sure I'm not full of shit
yeah, if we can do that, that's fine.
but yeah, the end use case is just being able to run our stuff in 10.04+
however we do that, I don't think anyone would care :p
also, @JajaB have you been looking at caesium, we're pretty close to finally running functions :p
nah, you can kill it
anyways, pair programming time
goodbye!
1.0.3 is the important one now
Hmm, lemme see
looks better ^.^
they're two different things I think
whenever a build comes in
we zip it up
and store it there
that's used for rollback deploys
yeah, that's what I said :p
but people said it was fine for now
Hmmm
it's been
probably a month?
you can delete anything that's not a zip file in there
I know there's some directories in there
you can delete those
just keep the ####.zip files
yeah....
it needs to be a proper file server
it came from that
yeah
i guess the ebs volume was for testing
not sure if we want to productize it now
It's a 1TB volume, so we have time
Talked to Laurent, he said there's still time to think about the proper solution, it's not just storage, but also how it will be maintained in the future, like, we should only be keeping the latest X builds for every project, not everything, so those parts should also be put into place before we decide how we'll store things.
cool :p
I removed a bunch of unused dirs
now it's only 14 GB ^.^
anyways, back to pairing!
I brought that same thing up!!!
I wanted to store things by directory
but they told me to forget that and just store it all in one dir as the build id -.-
GAH!
screw the name!
man*
>.> man, you need to be in more of these conversations so that I'm not the only one saying this stuff to people :p
-.-
alrighty, back to pair programming!
Hmm
not worried about building packages
but more so about building the clibs
and making sure their dependencies are appropriately met.
oh?
hmmm
is it like a virtual machine of sorts?
oooh
oh my
it's like you've taken my breadth away
installing it now, gonna play around with it.
hmmm
gonna have to learn how to use it...first time I ran the command it failed
ah, I need debootstrap adn devscripts
yeah
hmm
this is a lot to play around with for now...my head is not feeling great today, I'll try to look into it later though
yeah
seems simple enough, just got drowned in docks and got a headache while reading it
but no biggie, I'll look at it tomorrow
hahahha
also, yay @JajaB how does it work?
okie dokie
so it'll output that to the console?
also, what are the exit code statuses that I should worry about?
so keep the build going even if cache flush fails?
Hmmmm, fair enough
but shoudl probably log it somewhere?
gotcha
er
you mean edgecast?
yeah, we're doing that
right right
yup
we are
sweet
and....I should probably only flush the varnish caches after we upload and sync the new slug
lol
ok
oh yeah, the MPS cache
lol
I worked so hard
to tune down the build time
I refuse to add a sleep 15 :p
yeah, true
Yeah....
yeah
@JajaB what do you think about forking a process that sleeps 10 seconds and then runs the flush cache?
k
hmm
do you know how to guarantee that a subprocess I spawn in ruby does not get killed when the parent dies?
I guess I can do fork, I was hoping for a more elegant way :p
yeah, I guess I'll do fork, :p
yup yup, alrighty :p
cool
I'm still not done with the code :p
is that really bad?
k
lol
heheh
ha
I'm game for all production level logs that personally insult me.
oooh, link to ticket?
nice
that is the most adorable thing i've ever seen
woots
Figured it wouldn't hurt to have a another pair of eyes on this
cool, merging.
ready to check?
/me is about to push
ooh
ok
whaaaa
did it log an error (it should've)
of course
waits 10 seconds :p
should be roughly 10 seconds after the push is over since we do it at the very end
Hmm
hmm
but if it's getting flushed at all
it means that it's being called
weeeeeeird
maybe Process.detach changes the name of it?
hmm?
I see
so it might not be calling it after all
hmm
gah
blaaaaaah
blah
that means i need to make a shell script that wraps the logging and execute that from the fork
with nohup
I see
but that loses the logging
nope
Might wrap everything into a separate ruby script and execute that with nohup
Hmmmmm
We don't have the hostnames at that level
but yeah, I'll figure something out
I'd do it now, but we're heading to a Go meetup soon
Yup, no worries.
thanks!
will do
ooooh
that might be better ^.^
hahaha
alrighty, later
@Z I took a quick look at the sterlingjewlers project, it seems like everything is setup ok, but they don't have our IP address white listed, so when our servers try to hit them, we just time out
at least that's what my intuition is
why not?
oh wait
are you saying that the space is there?
oh
yeah
that's a fail
complain to the apollos
@cneale Shane has complaints for you.
I agree, we should check that the input for that is relatively close to a real domain.
supposed to copy to clipboard
yeah
I've complained about that too
holy shit
@GGTY is on fire
and yet, you're able to recall all these tickets.
<3 redbull zero
(content)
sounds like a bad idea
sounds like a worse idea
@MattMo for the absolutize_src ticket, did you want to use \z or \Z?
the ticket says \z, but I think \Z makes more sense?
\z and \Z are slightly different
so
/hi\Z/
will match
"hi"
and "hi\n"
/hi
sorry
/hi\z/
will only match "hi"
right, exactly
\z is end of string
so you have to be explicit
with the new line
so to match "hi\n"
with lower case z
you have to say
/hi\\n\z/
but capital Z let's you have a new line in there or not
or rather, it will match it with a new line or without
Hmm
Hmm, now that I think about it, lower case z might be more appropriate for this case
ok, well, @G3 replaced ^ adn $ with \A and \z
show meeeeee
ouchies
ok
we'll keep it at \z for now.
sorry
was investigating
hmm
HmmmI think that since it's a lowercase z, it would capture everything once as a whole
@MattMo http://rubular.com/r/lubNZloQKL
oh
so
if you don't have the "m" option
then it would not match at all
they do if you use lazy string match
Hrmrmr
or maybe not
what happened?
ew, tritium bug?
file ticket!
*goes back to making coffee*
Lemme benchmark it
Cool
weeeeee
@JajaB thanks
@JajaB wait, seriously?
I was planning on just using them as they were, you didn't have to do that!
But thanks!
lol
thanks
1.0 is the one we support
You can haz all the features!
(allthethings)
We output that info in the stats I think
Slug cache size
Yeah, prolly useage, I can double check when I'm back in the office
@SeanJ it was a mixer change, reassigned to Greg P, we've discussed the issues, new mixer will be released by today, including tests.
omg
I want to cry
is this a customer issue?
like, a live issue right now/
yes
Hm, what error are you seeing?
oh dear
that's not good
lemme investigate
k
@aparna the Mixer.lock file for that project is malformatted
it needs a space between the version and the name
Cool
np
?
if it's a rebuild, it doesn't show a commit hash
yup
eh
that's weird
looks like a brew bug
run brew update, hopefully it's fixed in a newer release
yeah
lol
I'll make the changes soon
evaluating...
@hcatlin code looks fine.  I like the initiative and drive that was necessary to code that.  I don't really care that much about the quality of hte code itself, but more so about the individual.
Good coding practices can always be taught to good people
I like the concept, he's basically doing part of what we did, the git deploy system, and then the server architecture
It is a little messy, pretty messy actually, but I assume all personal projects are messy
If you're working on something on your own, it'll always be messy
But it's really cool.  I approve on the coding regard.
@hcatlin something I would love to ask him is how he would feel about rewriting it from scratch.  What would he change, would he change anything? What would be better/worse
Oh? You mean like this beauty? https://github.com/mdayaram/gitsy
(allthethings)
Let's get that guy in here for an interview STAT
Give them everything they ask for!
Yeah
I agree
although
I like that you can run go source code without compiling it
using go run
obviously it compiles it on the fly
and then runs it
but have the command to do that is pretty neat
lol :p
what meeting?
wait, we're meeting about something?
(rdcry)
It's ok, I'll just cry myself in my new corner
what's it about?
maybe I should crash it
ahhh
I would crash, but I guess I'm too busy
btw
@JajaB did you know I'm leaving for nearly all of November?
@cneale
@cneale
@cneale
(catbug)
@all bye for most of November!
pictures will be taken if i don't forget to pack my camera!
@aparna yeah, the update is done =)
Thanks (content)
more is to come! hopefully the upcoming updates will go as seamlessly as this one >.>
oooh
I've seen some stuff in SFO regarding hello kitty
but not this particular one
they have a dress made of hello kitty-type plushes in sfo
ooh, I like the polaroid-like camera (content)
marcipan? Interesting
isn't that just like candy?
there's no way to get around the prompt other than setting the cookie
you can set the cookie under .moovapp.com, and that will work
you can do it from any website under moovapp
is the website that's hosting the iframe not under moovapp?
then clicking OK on the original prompt (the one that takes you to the main website should add the cookie under .moovapp.com
so the iframe should just work
is that not the case?
oh, sorry, I misread
Hmm, yeah, sorry, don't know what to tell you.  Only way to bypass the prompt is by having that cookie set
you could do...
in the config.json
have something like
hostmap: "mycompletely.differentsite.com => bar.com"
where mycompletely.differentsite.com is a domain that you own
and setup DNS for that
while the upstream is the site that you don't own
yeah
okie dokie, cool
cool
@MichaelCatlin can prolly help you with that
@bkendz @Cagri @enahs @iceman @aparna and anyone else I'm forgetting, the dev leads meeting is in dog path, it's the room next to what used to be Tarun's office
Oh my
so, should be correcting this
give me two minutes
@bkendz can you try now, 2.0.218 should be fine now
woot
This looks exactly the same as campfire
okie doke
cool
Can i delete my campfire account?
I want to experiment for forever
I'm totally on the boat on hipchat
Link test!

It didn't include the video in the chat =(
Link test with an image!
http: //i.qkme.me/3phxbf.jpg
w00t, at least that works
Excellent
*officially closes campfire tab*
did you download the app?
I just use the web ui
I hate adobe air
That's terrifying
btw
If any of you use pandora
and hate the adobe air desktop app
I recommend pithos
So you just need first names?
@manoj
@noj
fail
how can i turn notifications off?
They're starting to annoy me..
cool
Yeah
the notifications could be better in Linux, not sure how they are in mac
anyways, training time
adios
hey guys!  I'm in the training!
Sean is talking
and now he's gone
Tarun took over
#liveupdates
Tarun:   First ttraining, rough around the edges
Michael and Yvonne showed up late
mad disruption
Ajay is peering through the window
Not currently, I thought you mentioned that people using the gems have their environment set up with local clibs, so I didn't include them, but it's easy enough to include I think.
yeah
Not sure who makes the call, but either option should be viable
Tarun explain Moovweb origins
yeah
Tarun:   Explaining three steps of our technology
1) website virtualization
2) First class front end dev
3) power...the slide changed =(
Oh man, Tarun whipped out his linux VM
Showing off the nytimes project
Comments from the crowd:   "That's so cool!"
Your name is the name in the author of th egem : p

Michael's up
He's rubbing his arms a lot.

moov generate works for 3.4.57!
Well, I dunno, I'm just saying : p
Michael has started a text editor war
It was short lived
yeah
No casulties.
moov server works (as long as you spell wikipedia correctly)!
oh oh
Changing something in main.scss did not update the page =(
hmm, ok, so the debian package does not come with compass and all those other things, those still have to be installed separately
I'm a sad panda right now
things are not working on the latest 3.4 package as smoothly as I hoped
I laugh internally
but serious face on the outside
no success for me yet =9
I even fail at emoticons
Z is installing 1.9.2 in my laptop, hopefully will cure my problems.
vagrant?
I...do not...know
If you mean production machines, you should ask Chris, I don't think we have a standard dev machine setup
Nah, they just gave me a blank laptop, had to install everything i wanted myself : p
Yeah, I don't think we  have anything setup for devs
logging.go
That was Z
compiling of 1.9.2 failed
my computer hates me

memes?  that's a real nap pod sir.
I was the biggest supporter for nap rooms in Salesforce :p
Naps are power man.
Specially when they're power naps.
You? nap mvp/
That's for sure, you're terrible at it now.
Man, and now you're actually fighting to avoid naps, what happened to you man?
Naps always win
I took a nap when I got back home from work today.  when i woke up, i realized everything I was doing was wrong, and started redoing it the right way :p
Well, hopefully the right way, maybe I should take another nap to confirm.
yup
nice
I put the deb stuff on hold, the package itself works fine, the warning is just scary if you're using the UI
As for Apollo, I believe the problem is that nojenkins can't talk to nosaka
I'm gonna run some tests later today to make sure of that.
Yeah, versioned mixers will be in place by the end of tonight
True, but we should hopefully have it going by middle of tomorrow
Yups, well, that's my hope anyways
alrighty
night
I thought varnish was not handled by manhattan
ah
that's weird, how does the sdk know to use it if there's no command line flag for it?
Just uses it automatically?
So as someone running the sdk, how would I turn varnish on now?
Oh, ok, so the bug is that the option is gone, got it
Should be in the git history too, right?
yup
later
windows 2000 is my goto windows
Also because they have very poor piracy detection, so it's easy to get working copies of it for mad cheaps >.>
And by mad cheaps, I mean free <.<
@hampton packages are in nosakafs01
I leave the rest to you my good sir.
Yup
Yeah...we talked about it before
I thought the assumption was that we would only support linux 12.04 and higher
which comes with glibc 2.14+
Yeah man, we're the bleeding cutting edge.
haha
but yeah, we're gonna bundle glibc now
so lesser versions will now be supported.
We're all about making people happy
It'll just make the package pretty big.
Alternatively
We could have an installer
which checks what libraries are already installed
and only pulls/compiles the ones that aren't already there.
Mornin' matt
Yeah, we can probably add glibc to the debian package pretty easily with depends
but for the gem/brew, we would have to include it in there.
right
I'm assuming everything we're bundling right now we're modifying
glibc, we would just include as is
ugh
which makes the build process uglier
dammit glibc
Oh man, nearly all the work I do is trying to prettify it :p
@sean what do you mean?
ha
^ My reaction to standing desks
@sean here is a gem with the libs in it
Try it out, let me know if all goes well
I guess that would make it a different gem actually.
Is it as easy as go test rails?
go test all the things
Also, standing desks kill you just as much as sitting desks

@jaja

hipchat should have an option to only beep/notify if someone mentions your name
=(  I don't want to use their air app either...
Sound off in general it is!
@hampton are you using the web client?
what browser?
then it's a linux fail
Yeah, for me, checking/unchecking that turns sounds for all messages on/off
same with jaja
I'm back
(troll)
oh man
you can upload your own emoticons?
brilliant
I know what I'm going to do tonight
='(
@hampton can you give me and @mat admin access so we can add some wicket emoticons?
@sean ignore previous messages about gems.
@sean This gem works in linux, give it a try in mac
@hampton No, you're paying us to emoticon and MORE
(dosequis)
@hampton is everything OK on the apollo end for the packages?
Excellent. (indeed)
ok, I think that's gonna have to wait for an OK from @sean
so apprently
my computer hates me
the debian packages work fine in jaja's comp
but complain in mine
so
yeah
I do not
What linux versions would you like to test it on?
Ok
The current one is LTS, both me and Josh have it and it works fine there
I'll grab virtualbox and test it out in a few couple of different versions of ubuntu and debian
jaja is gone
forevers
sad face
now I am gone to
it just doesn't end
why is everyone leaving you?
good bye
it's in manhattan
err
it's called by the data.py script
so jenkins script calls data.py
Hmm, I really like the email feature of hipchat
Hmm
I'll take a looksy, did you change the syntax of creating the tritium package?
Hmm, looks like the package job failed because fpm failed...which is weird...
ah
it's a repeat job
ok
should succeed this time.
It'll automatically get kicked off
yup
actually
so
if there's a job, say tritium forexample
We can add a post hook
which will search all jobs in jenkins, check for their dependencies, and kick them off if tritium is in there
The script to do that is available
But right now the only job we have is manhattna
manhattan
so it's not really being used
sure
Hmmm
Yeah, m-build triggers m-package and m-gem
Sorry, i don't understand the reasoning behind having m-package trigger the gem?
oh
neither run tritium package
tritium package is run by the ambrosia job
(to create the libxml.tpkg file, so that we can make the mixers)
yeah
So the mixers are made by ambrosia job
and then both m-package and m-gem pull the latest mixer from a common location
sorry, I must've misunderstood
or depending on when you asked me, that used to be true
It was pulled out into its own job yesterday
That's where the mixers get dumped
If you've updated the ambrosia project, then the omni-mobile-mxr job should run on its own.
and the gem job just pulls the latest mixer from there
ah
Ok
yeah, ok, I get it now
Yeah, so what we can do is add a job for tritium, and then add a post hook to build ambrosia
Ok.
Hmm, I'm having some trouble trying to get the virtual machines to work
in my virtual box that is
I'm thinking of just spinning up some amazon ec2 instances and just checking the packages there instead.
If QA's use mac, we might want to make parallels disk images then.
I think virtual box will let you create whatever, but parallels and vmware will only read their formats
Actually, let me try vmware instead of virtual box, might be more reliable
cool
Yeah, the issue with virtual box is that it doesn't like my laptop =(
But I got ISOs for the past three debian and ubuntu versions...so if we have a normal laptop, it should work just fine.
trying things out in aws for now
k
later
yup
@sean Here's a gem built from jenkins2

when are we gonna have admin access
so we can add our own emoticons
hmmmmmmmmmM?

You can just admin me to add the emoticons
and then you can unadmin me
woa woa
you would relinquish such power?
That seems unwise.
no logs on private chats?
w00
I'll add the emoticons tonight
cause now is work time

coffee and coke go surprisingly well together

I'm sure no one would mind if we spend the money we spend on normal coke for bawls, no?
@hampton told me I was the only one who drank the normal coke
I am fine with it going in exchange for bawls
airgo, bawls it is
you will learn to love bawls

@hampton one day you should jump kick the pinata

@jaja What do you mean by the libxml repo being wrong?
I see
So we just had an older version?
I thought we were altering libxml2
which is why we had our own repo
is that not the case?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
@jaja, you mean you made a new repo, or a branch?
Hmm
nothing some (tea) can't fix
tea
fixes all the things
(allthethings)
Hmm
@jaja, so we should probably just cherry-pick their updates and merge them to our current repo?
the hell was that
oh, twitter link
I see
but it wont have our changes?
http: //twitter.com/EmergencyPuppy/status/207565820182806528
ah
ok, no worries
then, I thought you mentioned before that we did a lot of changes
Excellent (indeed)
cool
They do if they're....special comments
preproc comments?
cool!
lol
Hmm
I wonder
will that mess with the current jenkins job linked to that repo?
It's cool, if I clear the workspace, it should be fine, right?
k
Let me know when it's done and I'll clear the workspace in nojenkins and jenkins2
btw, @hampton, if anything, you are unweird.
I'm ready
Let's do it
I love me some sweet dde64081f9440b898cd856fad99bd8b7ede6b39a
fail, but for a different reason =(
Do you know what that error is jaja?
ok...but it failed in linux too =/
ok
looks like in mac we also need libtool
Hmm?
It has libtool?
k
Lets see
@jaja what happened?  Me and Z were troubleshoothing something
@jaja, I can ssh into the mac and install stuff, what do you need there?
?
Hmm
sure, give me a minute, need to test some golog
cool
sorry, was in and out troubleshooting some golog stuff
which btw, @hampton, it's not only a palindrome, but also our new awesome logging framework
@jaja, the linux one seems like it's good too
cool

Well, generall intalls actually
installs*
Took longer than 120 to get the deb
brew
makes me very sad
No, not just that
we changed the fileness
filenames*
so no more _amd64 prefixes
so that the default for brew is fine
But there are other issues
which I'm working on
which make me sad
because of brew
=(
(rdcry)
Right, either way, changes in apollo will have to happen
We opted to changing the filenames
As opposed to adding a version tag in the brew formula
Hmm, we probably should've consulted you to find out which was easier for you =x
Which one do you prefer actually, cause it's easy enough to change it back in our end.
Okie doke
then that's done
Right, but we haven't deployed the newest files to apollo yet, we won't until you fix the file lookup.
do you get what i mean?

@zhigang 184.169.222.83
@hampton no worries, I fixed it by simply deleting/recreating the global gemset.
I did, Michael has the right link
emo.hazasite.com should also work.
...until it ends in failure.
Yeah...a decent amount of stuff will have to change to accomodate windows on the build tools.
That's fine
also
Does windows have a tool like ldd?
We're using ldd and otool to only include the specific shared libraries that we use
to cut down the size of the packages.
I noticed we now have a libyaml
We're just racking these guys up.
oh?
Hmm
ok
fair enough
of course not
too free for my blood
What hacks are we currently employing?
ah, for the ssl issue, sorry, didn't read the context.
Yeah, I figured we'll be getting a lot of build breakages as you play around with windows
It's fine by me, this is the time where we have to iron these things out anyways.
I went ahead and changed most of the build scripts to be windows friendly, at least the ones you missed anyways :p
I saw your comment about that
What kind of error do you get?
lol
that sucks
Hmm
That would be pretty nice
would it cause more problems though?
Yeah, that sucks, I liked the fact that we could use the same IFS as normal path dirs in unix.
Hmm
So what's a good IFS then?
Hmm
You know
given all these issues
I wonder if it's worthwhile creating an environment in the build scripts for windows
So that the build script sources it
and it sets all these little things
Right now I guess it would only set the IFS token
Hmm
Okie doke, but if we have to add one more thing, I'd rather outsource it all into a windows environment file
:p
ugh
This means
that we'll need to stick if windows, use ;, else use : everywhere
freshen?
Not sure where this freshen things comes into play though, but yeah, that's right.
Here, I'll add the token, and submit, and I'll remove your check at the top
right
I see
so building just does the exe, and we don't need to package anything, it's already done.
VERSION var should be available to you depending what target you're running
Is this during hte push?
Yeah, that's fine, we might have to if they differ too much
Hmmm, can you do a write up of the entire flow of making a windows exe and all the things that go along with it?
I want to get a better idea of the process to know where we need to stick it in to our current system.
ok
and once we have the manhattan.exe, what else do we need?
And setup.exe will include manhattan.exe plus the clibs
and will install them in some location.
ok
I see, so the packaging needs to be done in the windows box.
that's fine.
not even with wine? :p
That's fine.
I recommend you put the packaging stuff into a wininstall script under the build directory, do you know how the hierarchy works?
wininstall, or winpkg, whatever
Yeah, we still need to put the steps to package it somewhere, where are they now?
Cool, so we just need to supply those env vars, update the files, and call isbuild
sounds good
Ok, so lets set up those steps so that we can do it using nogo
so if you're inside manhattan
Hmm
Perhaps we should make a separate repo?
k
and I'll fix the IFS stuff
oh? I did not.  What does that entail, is it complicated?
I guess what i'm getting at is if it's worth upgrading or not
btw @josh looks like we have some security issues
Is the windows machine managed by Chris?  If so, we need to ask him to add the public key in puppet
cool, but looks like everything else is good
yup yup, i are the sillies.
regarding protobuf
yeah
the IFS part is a little janky
but it'll do I suppose
cool
Becuase that's basically the same thing
only that you want to restrict it to run in windows only
Excellent
oh
I sees a problem
You changed the build.py script to output an .exe
Cool
oh?
I thought --login was only necessary for the ssh command
man, freaking windows.
>.<
anyways, gonna get lunchies, be back in a bit.
@jaja even if we put the path in quotes?
Yeah, it is....
Hmm
I see
This is weird though, that means that rsync would never work in windows
Cause it would always thing you're using the c protocol
What's the version of rsync that we have in mingw?
says nothing about windows -.-  sad face
I see
Yeah, I guess we'll have to have a separate env for windows.
screw this, let's go home
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyltK6pmJGg
lol
in all seriousness, this is major suckage.
It's going to cause me to rewrite the build scripts like for the 50th time
I hate building
It makes me cry at night.
(rdcry)
OK, give me an hour or so while I try to come up with a new design for this nonsense
sounds good
@jaja whenever you get back, why do you prepend an "x" when checking if uname is equal to MINGW32...?
if [[ "x`uname`" == "xMINGW32_NT-6.1" ]]; then
What's up with that?
ok
This is what I got, feel free to chime in with suggestions
Right now, the nogo script sources a bunch of environment scripts based on the name of the project, the environment (dev or jenkins) given via the command line, and the command (build, push, test, deb, etc...)
Ultimately, all these scripts are set up either in the env directory or the targets/<cmd>/ directory
And they all *should* just set up the vars in order to make the actual script work.
Right now we had the actual command scripts being separated the same way, but that doesn't really make sense, as in, it's unlikely that they stuff you'll be doing is different in jenkins than it is in dev, it's just the input that is different
so I'm going to differ those guys in the OS part
and ok, yeah, what I said doesn't really sound like it makes sense, but if you got it, feedback would be good, but otherwise, I think it's pretty decent.
I'll get started on that.
I believe this is already in seans radar
I tried to play around with it myself, but couldn't get too far.
There was only one code change between 122 and 136, so it shoudl not be too bad.
I see
really?
"" == "" is not valid bash?
That seems silly
What do you mean?
ah
yeah
so if you don't use quotes, it's useful, but with quotes, it's not needed, got it.
silly bash
I should fix that elsewhere too then
also
why [[ stuff ]] instead of just [ stuff ]?
Yup, I use it everywhere
Hasn't let me down yet =x
Actually, let me check if it works in mingw real quick, maybe it's a bash version thing
yup, works fine
btw
That's the jenkins windows box, right?
link didn't work
er
ok
nvm
yeah, I just saw a link and was compelled to click it :p
What's the jenkin's user pass?
oh?  What's the user that does all the building?
ah, what's the admin pass?
@jaja If you pull the latest
in manhattan
And only machines running in windows will call that one, and everyone else will call push.sh
That way we can keep things separate, but equal
Cause we're all operating systemists here.
MOCHA!
wow wow wow
Mr. fancy pants
also
@jaja, are you just going to convert the paths from c:\ to \c\ in the push@windows.sh script?
If so, I'd like to check the IFS value to colon to keep things cleaner.
yay, let me know when you're done, in case you change your mind, and if it's all good, I'll change it back
Looks good to me
oh
you might want to do that before the loop
since the loop breaks it apart with IFS
lame sauce
i hate my windows life
https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23fmwl
yeah...
Hmm, @hampton, the binaries, packages, etc... are sorted by gitbranch
or rather, organized in a subfolder corresponding to their git branch
BOOM is windows fucking finally playing nice
yup
well
right now we have git branches for releases
so
release_3.4
oh, you're talking about how we install it?
Well, for brew, brew sets the directory structure for us
So how are we planning on doing that update?
Sounds good
yeah
Well
Are you saying you want to force upgrade sdk customers?
But what if they don't want to upgrade?
I see.
and just change it around with a link
lol
Yeah, we need to talk about that too
The current way we package mixers is a little weird.
err
well
right now
I'm putting them in a data directory under the install dir
but we should really just dump them into ~/.manhattan
and we shoudl also rename ~/.manhattan into ~/.moovweb
I see
Sounds good
I like that
so
Are you saying something like
when you start moov, and it checks with apollo, apollo tells it to self update?
In terms of installs, we can always do something like /usr/local/Cellar/moovweb/3.5
/usr/local/Cellar/moovweb/3.4
/usr/local/Cellar/moovweb/current -> 3.5
And then we run everything off of current.
yay unix
not sure if we can do the same on winnie
Also, don't know enough about brew to know if it'll let us do that, but I think we're swithcing to a normal mac installer, so it should be fine then.
oh
oh
I just remembered
I assume we can tell it to dump our files in whatever layout we want.
Hmmm
Well, it depends
we can create a dmg
and then have a Moov.app
or we can create an install package
that just follows our directions (I assume)
Need to look into it more, but I think it's much like installshield.
I'm intrigued
Hmmm
I'm not sure if it's worth it
Before we spend time playing with it
I like the fact that right now we're outputting customized packages for each platform.
It's a pain in the ass for us
but it's awesome for our users
if I'm in linux, I just install a debian pacakge
windows, just an installer
mac, it's just brew
I don't want to create more headaches for our users if they have to install some extra stuff in order to run our installer
Well, what is stopping mac from installing it out of the box?  Is it the lack of xcode and brew?
because of glibc?
We still need glibc
if glibc comes by default without xcode then we're good
also, libyaml
I wish we could have apple AWS machines
it would make me so happy
to test all these things out.
so sad
Everyone makes me so sad
except linux
Yeah, but if we mess with the environment and we need to test something on a fresh machine again, the only way to do it is to reformat it =(
lolsy
Hmm, I suppose
Maybe we can invest in a mac mini for developer playthings
err, are you talking about a virtualized hackintosh?
such a stubborn child
sigh

@aaron I had the most awesomest fries today

@jaja you stripped the .exe
w00
@jaja, we'll probably want to add .exe back to the files? or no?
okie dokie lokie
fair enough
This makes me very happy
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/win.png
oh, weird
the manifest is for manhatta/mps
not manhattan
The manifest for mps is fine
I'll investigate
oh
you know what...
the manhattan/mps manifest probably overrides the manhattan one
fail
but then it should happen to everyone, not just windows
I'd argue that nearly all libs probably use autoconf/automake
all public libs anyways
I've never encountered a public lib that I didn't have to install by doing configure, make, and make install
I would say that it makes libsass more legit
But I would also be speaking out of my domain
so I will refrain from saying that :p
But will think it very hard.
Hmm
@jaja how did you install python in the windows jenkins machine?
I'm finding a lot of guides online that do it differently, so figured I'd ask you to keep things consistently.
lol, I'm silly
I was ready to compile python from source in mingw :p
yups
lol
they couldn't run mac vms on top of OS X using parallels?
well, I guess having the linux interface makes it easier to communicate with the vms prolly :p
that sucks.
Hmmm
Salesforce had virtualized environments for iphone/ipad...
I forgot what they did to get that though...
I could ask one of my friends about it next time I see them.
w00t
nice
do we want to call it something other than setup-219?
Maybe moovweb-3.5.219-setup.exe?
:p
You can grab the version
I do that for the other guys
There's a python file
versn.py
oh
but it needs to know which version to grab, no?
otherwise, how does it know what to package?
oh, by job number
and branch
ok
Hmm
Hmmm, how does the gem stuff know what the version is...let me check
Oh, that's right, it uses an ugly ass hack, awesome
the repo has a VERSION file which needs to be kept in sync with manhattan's VERSION file.
and then it appends whatever it finds inside a JENKINS file if it's there
It's silly
I guess you coudl copy the same way of doing it, but...ugh
Yeah, but then you need to update the version file of all these misc repos
whenever you upgrade
for now I saw we can keep it as setup-BUILD_NUMBER.exe
let's not change it unless we really need to
whatevs
oh,yay
okie doke
nice
also, I haven't tried the latest install files
but the install file you emailed a while back
that one had incredibad in the data folder
these don't, right? =x
cool
Yeah, you can grab the latest mixers from userContent/mixers
Hmmm
I think we're currently using hermes
but you should use versions instead
hermes is gonna die
Hmm, I guess you'll have to build it into an exe, yeah
but just to be clear, I'm referring to our versions repo :p
@sean, saw your email
reverting to include all the clibs should be easy, I'll check a little bit around to see if it's something else though
However, if we revert to include all the clibs, then the size will become significantly larger for the gems.  For debian and brew, the size only increases a few megs.
Since we only use gems internally (I assume), then that's probably fine, no/
?
In general, I'm not a fun of culling the clibs at all, I'd rather include them all every time if possible...
yeah
yup, taking a look.
So the libs that I'm adding in definitely don't include that, but looking at the complete list of libs, it seems that the one that is being referenced is a soft link to the lib that we do include.
We include the actual library, but it looks like the program is trying to refrence it by a different name
So technically we don't include it..perse.
do you get what I mean?
Right, not sure.  it might be OS dependent.
That's my best guess
We determined the binaries to include by calling otool -L on the binary, and then otool -L on every lib that it was dependent on (for linux we used ldd).
And we just wrote down the libs we got and included those
but otool in a different version of mac could return something different maybe?
Let me ask Kevin to run otool -L on the binary
yeah, perhaps that makes a difference.
sigh
never listening to theory again.
Hmm, yeah
heh
In salesforce, we had a span of roughly a month where the code line would freeze and the only thing you can do is bugfixes.
Then again, the release cycle there was three times a year.
can I take a look?
yeah, we need to freeze at least a week before, if not two.
k
ok
Well, I asked Kevin to send me the output of otool, but regardless, i'm going to start adding all the clibs back again.
yeah
sure
I feel like our vpn is very flaky
Mine dies almost consistenly around 6:30ish
yeah
They're probably hooked up via vpn as well, no?
Let me try the link with my vpn on and off
and see what happens.
Well, i'm at home right now
but I also have my vpn set up
so I can just toggle it and see what happens
blargh
my wifi is too fast
in vpn i got the timeout
Hmm, I found a tool that will simulate a slow network, trying it out
Yup
Yup, download went 1 minute and 30
and was totally fine
in vpn I got a timeout after 60s
He said the connection was being closed by the client
yeah
Hmm
Who set up our vpn?  Was that Chris as well?
I feel like this might be a VPN setting.
like
close all connections longer than 60 seconds
wel
makes sense if you have a fragile vpn
Hmm, yeah
btw
clibs are added back in 147
I'm downloading all the packages right now to check to make sure it's all good
k
yeah, no worries
k
cool
yay data
oh
I can't fix that issue in brew
That's something hampton has to add in moovweb.rb in apollo
the other packages shouldn't have that problem as they're not copying anything over to .manhattan
yeah
k
(rdcry)
I can make the change in apollo, looks like a simple fix
yeah
Hmm, ok.
Should we just tell him to add the fix himself then?
Well, I'll make the fix and test it and, we'll see how it goes.
What branch is production apollo off of?
I'm assuming that's for the master branch
k
I'm unpacking them and making sure all the libs are included in the right place.
I was gonna test more thoroughly after finishing the apollo fix
Yeah
Hmm
since we'll have to call sudo to chown
would it be easier to just do the cp with sudo?
I see, so just the fact that it's owned by root is a mistake, k.
Even though we ran into that issue with compass 0.12.1?
Oh, so you're saying change the compass version to 0.11.7
yeha
yea*
Well, on the gem, we currently specify 0.12.1, we can change that back down to 0.11.7
Yeah
yup, I'm on board.
I'll make the changes to the gemspec and also apollo
Actually
apollo never updated to say 0.12.1
so we're good on that front :p
K, I'll update the gem then.
K, reverted to 0.11.7
Having some issues with testing the apollo fix because my bundle install seems to be broken -.-
oh
I remembered why I thought that the one click mac install might be problematic
One of the reasons why we needed it was because brew requires xcode, and we wanted to skip that, right?
oh, nevermind
I just remember telling this to someone else, and it was not an issue.
so yeah, one click mac install would be awesome
ugh
it's failing on some weird compile issue with the mysql gem -.-
I should be able to just do bundle install in the directory and everything should just work, right?
yeah
oh, then how do I test it out?
Oh, yeah, but I figured I would grab the rendered moovweb.rb file that rails renders for me from the server.
I guess it's the same though
alrighty, yeah, I've tested like that before
that would be sweet.
That's fine.
btw, tested apollo change, seems to be working fine, though are we ok with having to enter a password everytime someone runs brew install?
I see
yeah, I'll play around with it some more
Not exactly sure what the fix entails.  What was it about?
sure
okie doke
tested pretty thoroughly, is working well
Yeah, that already happened, 147 should have old compass and all the libs
I'm going to push my branch to apollo
And I guess we'll get hampton to approve a merge tomorrow?
ok, I'm going to test the gem/debian, and brew packages for 147 on cancer to make sure the sanity test.
k
ok, sounds good
Oh
Should I tell Kevin to use the 147 gem?
k
k
Are you talking about this?
k
heh
Well, I tested deb and brew
they're both fine
I'm trying to test the gem, but for some reason, my connection slows down to a crawl when I try to download it.
(methinks it might be related to the timeout issue)
db?
ah
weird
Were you on VPN when you hosted it there?
yeah, so I realized why the gem is so gargantuan
it looks like the gem does not maintain the symlinks
instead, it turns each symlink into a copy of the file it was linking to
so the gem ends up having duplicates of all these clibs.
brew and debian handle this normally, which is why those packages are so small compared to the gem
yeah
Yup
Hmm
Man, debugging at night, ain't nothing like it :p
You should pull the go-build-tools
you must have a *really* old version
if it's complaining about sets
What's your GOPATH?
what happens if you do go list -json manhattan/manhattan?
Hmm
weird..
ok, well, tested 147 deb, brew, and gem on cancer, just clicked a few links starting from the home page, everything looked fine.
yup, np
hah, past manoj, what a newb
Nope, don't even think he knows how to spell.
Oooh
is requestBody a pointer?
If it's a slice of rawRequest
yeah
then it can be changed
How does it change?
If it suddenly starts with x-moov-secure: true, then it makes pretty good sense.
lolsy
oh slices
Yup, we need to allocate separate arrays there methinks.
Hmmm
Well
I see
There's no much else you can do
If we're going to edit them, they need to be separate
I guess another thing you could do is defer the array copy in the higher level
and only copy if you need to add moov-secure
so you can skip the copy in most(?) cases.
sounds good
he might have a better idea, we'll see how it goes
so I'm looking at the way gem build works
and I don't think there's anything we can do apart from changing the rubygems source that will let us maintain the symlinks

At the bottom is where it's writing the file to the tar io.
it's actually reading the file bytes, and writing those bytes through to the io...and reading the symlink will only return the source's bytes...
So I doubt there's anything we can do there, unless we want to manage the symlinks ourselves, but that seems very fragile/error prone.
So I guess we're stuck with 100MB gem for now.
okie doke, I'm hitting the bed
how's the fix working out?
k, cool

Alrighty, heading off

Hmm
but..they're so adorable.
Did I crash @Ham ?
I get confused easily, so I made this:
mahattan is the internal version of moov that has extra tools
We should
in the apollos
Until Hampton bumps up the version in Apollo, you won't be able to see it.
But the binary is there
I could give you a link from my dropbox where you could download 156
if that's fine with you.
everything is logged!
(twicrazy)
one min
Hmm
brew install https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/moovweb.rb
*should* work, let me know how it goes
oh, maybe my dropbox didn't sync the file yet :p
cool.
I'm taking the link down now
>.>
That's weird, @noj does not highlight your name anymore.
Seems to be working now
Maybe it was my crappy internet again.
Hmm
I do not, is the connection just too slow?
oh wow, 3 hours
yeah, sorry, can't help you there =x
If I were at home, I doubt the download would take more than 15 minutes :p

Had a spa day yesterday
Figured I'd share the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB0BhyMRXWM
Hmm
@hcatlin When did that happen?
Was it within the last few days?
Or just now?
I believe the puppet scripts that manage the clibs in some boxes changed, though I don't think they should've changed for that.
Chris and @zhigang probably have a better idea about this.
Right, but the reason why it's broken now is because the puppet scripts removed the clibs from the box, since 3.4+ doesn't need them.
ha

His name is discord.  Here's a song about him for those of you who don't know.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes
the only one required is libyaml
(for 3.4, 3.5 is including libyaml
no?
We're not including libyaml in 3.4 I thought
Oh?  Then why are we including libyaml in 3.5?
Hmmm, I
I'm not 100% sure about openssl, but I would keep it for now.
The sdk comes with the fake cert and keys, so they don't need to create them
but we might make them on the fly in the future.
Sure
Hmm
so I uninstall libyaml from my compy
and tried out moov compile, generate, server, and check
They all seemed to work just fine
BUT
we have a small problem.
the help message has a typo -.-
noj@moov-noj:~/moovweb-projects/nytimes$ moov\nInvalid mode\nUsage: manhattan command [options]\n\nManhattan SDK is a platform for developing and deploying site transformations.\n\nCommands:\n   generate   - Create a new Manhattan project\n   check      - Check Tritium syntax of a file\n   compile    - Compile project assets for deployment\n   production - Run just the HTTP proxy with no assets\n   server     - Run the full SDK\n   debug      - Simlar to server only with HTTP message logging\n   upgrade    - Upgrade a project to the current version of Manhattan\n   version    - Print the Manhattan version number\n
Simlar
That too...
>.>
So....
Do we want to update the help message and do a 157 release....or are we just gonna stick with this?
Ok, I spoke with Sean
We're gonna leave 3.4 alone and add any fixes to the help messages to 3.5
@ham help
ship it
That makes me happy again.
I didn't even say that word.
You know what gif doesn't suck?
BEES
@hcatlin that's just wrong.
It is a good song
Why don't you share it with the rest of the room?
@Hari We need to build that.
New moovweb side project.
Sean beat you to it
Platform room has now become a dance floor.
Sure, you want me to make a deploy job for mixers specifically?
http://turntable.fm/4fe3baa3eb35c159c200009f
@hcatlin Where in nosakafs01 does apollo check for mixers?
OK, then this is what it's going to be:
yup
Sometimes I feel that the best designed websites are those that just advertise their mobile app and do nothing more.
Look at you, all grown up and talking about sales.
So prouds.

=(
What didja break?
what's the difference?
Hmmm
k..
Let's talk when you get back.
Hmm, well, I guess what I don't understand is how that error even came to be.
Since the jenkins box should not be editing anything, just pull.
ah
Well, to fix it you can just wipe the workspace in jenkins
no need to change anything int he scripts.
Add the output files to .gitignore
coolio, I'll wipe the workspace in jenkins and kick off a new run.
Nope, that was my number one goal
if shit breaks, just wipe workspace and it just works.
@zhigang
Do you need help with the refactoring?
I figured since we need it done by Wednesday, we could work on that together, and then I could jump on other tasks after that.
Well, there's always things on my plate :p
There's the golog stuff, the signals flushing, one click mac installer
sure
@zhigang I made a util directory and stuck the stamp stuff under util/fileutil
Just to make sure I didn't mess anything up terribly, I'm assuming you're getting compile errors in the options-refactor branch too, right?
ok
yeah
a minute or so after I talked about it, try pulling now
@zhigang Other than for the tritium segments, we don't need anything else from generate, right?
project/generate and manhattan/generate.go
Not all of it though, just the creation of the tritium segments
The rest will go to apollo, right?
So we're changing recipe to generator?
Hmm
Ok, so should I wait before delete the project/generator folder then?  It doesn't seem like we're ready to remove it then.
@ham pug me
Hmm
Looks like
you are missing
libyaml
I think.
how do your clibs look like?
Yup
oh
actually
Are you exporting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/PATHTOCLIBS/lib
?
Nope, that's good
excellent
@zhigang ?
Yeah, if you get off of the VPN, the download should be fine.
bees
oh oh
That's weird.
so when he does brew install, the download just drops in the middle?
Is it after 60 seconds?
@michael who is this?
I have 156 on my dropbox ready to go if we wanna go that route.
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/moovweb.rb
cheers
sure
@hcatlin so everything that used to go to nosakafs is now going to S3, right?
Do we still want it in nosakafs?
are you asking which we'd prefer?
yeah
cool, I will once I'm done with the S3 stuff
Well, since we need this for 3.4, I'm sticking a quick and dirty ruby script to deploy it to S3 for 3.4
For 3.5 I'm not sure what I want to do yet.
@hcatlin 3.4.156 files are in S3
I'm going to edit the moovweb.rb file in apollo under the branch where the other edits are
this branch:  :brew_install_datapath_fix:
Once that's done, I'll have you take a quick look at it before merging in to master.
k
@sean brew_install_datapath_fix
YEAH
got apollo running locally
This calls for some dancing bees

@hcatlin I reran the job.  How does it look like now?
ok

yes
quite
excellent
refactor
ing
is
pretty
fun
sometimes
sometimes
it
makes

i
need

we

seems
to
not
be

enough

at

the
bees
are
nooooooo
sorry
I
was
being
careless
@sean I thought you were just being weird
be-es
I actually really love staring at the be-es
cracks me up every time.
It's just too funny
@michael is there a way to mute turntable temporarily?
ah
@zhigang such a bad idea
omg
That video is just full of bad ideas
for planet of the apes?
Pretty good trailer
has me sold
btw, where are the cloud instructions?
nvm, found them
excellent
@all what's more idiomatic, len(string) == 0 or string == ""?
k
I figured the length is stored in a field for the string, so that should be super quick
But I wasn't sure how the string comparison against and empty string is.
I assume the first thing it does is compare the length though
Yeah, I've been using len thus far
just wanted to make sure we were all consistent
oh wells
Sounds good to me.
okie doke
@jose I removed the gitignore you added
I'm assuming you added it because you were doing go build . inside that directory
But we don't want to hardcode something like that in gitignore
if you have your GOPATH set, then you can run "go build manhattan/manhattan" from anywhere
and it'll work
In whatever directory you choose to run go build manhattan/manhattan"
now I"m just sad
thumb drives ftw
They're legit.
@all Does every manhattan project have a functions directory where a main.ts file lives?
Hmm, okie dokie.
So it's possible that a project doesn't have a functions directory?
That's kind of odd, from our code, I feel like things would fail if it didn't.
*didn't have a main.ts file anyways.
ah
I see
Hmmm, ok.
You should pull the versions repo
Sorry, did you get it working?
ok
@jaja we're making the final touches to the refactor, we should have it merged in by the end of the day today
@jaja so feel free to enjoy your vacation to its full extent :p

om nom nom
delicious toe debris
The weird ones are always the geniuses.
my face is what's up with that.
my face...looking into it that is.
The build stable, jenkins is being funky
I think it's fine to branch from now.
Jenkins looks like it's having a weird env issue.
How long are you branching for?
golog will probably not change for a while
nah, just manhattan
btw
the mps folder is now under targets/mps
so if you're compiling using your GOPATH, you'll want to do go build manhattan/targets/mps
yay
excellent
Nice
Spreading the awesome.
I'll gladly take you up on that.
Or if you want to see me win a bet against Hampton, you could get me a bottle of moscato
Sure
Nice.
freaking protobuf...
Google removed a bunch of helper functions that we were using everywhere
So I basically had to rewrite them in butler and tell all our components to use it there instead of importing protobuf -.-
dammit google (rageguy)
Yea.  I had some friends working the maps API at salesforce, they would constantly complain about that too.
hopefully jenkins build works now though
We could just fork it into our own repo =x
Then we wouldn't have to deal with mercurial =D
well
Looks like I missed some =(
We can talk about that tomorrow
I'm going home
I'll fix the build later tonight.
Yup
(zzz)
night
yes
sup
@HariAnanth yup
Hmm
Yeah, you need a mixer
No way to start without one
what box are you running this from?
Oh, so you just don't have a mixer?
If you compile powermoov, you can create a mixer
powermoov mix -ambrosia-dir=/your/path/to/the/ambrosia/repo -tritium-dir=/your/path/to/tritium/repo
will create a mixer.
Make sure you pull, the mix command was just added like at 10 or so
just go ahead and clone it
How's it going?
Nah, you shouldn't have to move it
It should've created it in the right location
Yup, now just go ahead and run whatever you were running before
Right, the mixer is global
Weird, try pulling the code.google.com/p/protobuf repo
hg pull; hg update
then try regenerating the mixer
=/
oh, when you call hg, unset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
do you do hg update as well?
Hmm
Weird
Didn't we have this problem in the office too, and regenerating the mixer made it work?
can you check what's in your .moovweb/mixers directory?
Ah, that's the problem
0.1 is the one we generated
But when you run, it chooses 0.1.9 since it thinks it's newer
So if you just delete 0.1.9, youshould be good
yeah
Really?
Hmm
try deleting 0.0.243 too?
If that works, it means we need to make some updates to our version selection module
doh
Could you make an issue under the manhattan repo pointing this out?
thanks
Yeah
It's basically just incompatible with the latest code base.
what is?
Well, right now there's a couple of places that it's called from.  Server.go calls butler to load a mixer.  However, the apollo api hooks also load a mixer.  Eventually we'll push the loading to a mixer to butler.
So the version checking is going to be changing.  Before I believe we checked the MANHATTAN_VERSION file.  Now we will be checking a Mixer.Lock file
However that logic is not implemented yet.
Alrighty, I'm out for the night, g'night
@all sorry if I asked this before, but what exactly is the difference between the old manhattan and manhattanserver?
The code looks almost identical, so I feel like I'm probably missing something subtle.
Any differences between the binaries?
Or was it the same binary?
I see
oh, that would be good.
ok,
is moov production the only command they would need?
Cool, thanks.
@hcatlin I'm surprised too
no one told me
so sad
Can't believe I missed it.
interspecies hugging
warms my heart
@ZhigangChen I'm changing the build scripts to default to the master branch instead of the stable branch.
Yeah, we should get rid of that branch :p
Sounds good to me :p
@juan could you look into this?
@jose probably can answer that.
It can
Well, we're actually going to change that soon.
Instead of passing/using a logger everywhere
We want to pass/use a debugger everywhere
and the debugger will have the logger
What do you think?  We haven't really set this in stone, just an idea we threw around.
lol, the reason for it would be that it's simpler to initialize
give me a production debugger
give me a dev debugger
those are the two options
Can you elaborate on the issue?
from the logs you mean?
Right, that's the idea
the debug module lives in manhattan
so that's abstracted away
that way, if we decide to use a different logger int he future
just chagne it in debug
everyone else just uses that, they have no concept of a logger.
hm?
k
@tarun I hope you had two cups of milk with that
Hmm
Is there a reason why we can't cname help.moovweb.com to moovhelp.zendesk.com?
nevermind, just saw your ticket.
though when I go to help.moovweb.com, it just redirects me to zendesk.
I am (rdcry)
Nope, I just typed help.moovweb.com from my browser
typing
?
pong?
Yeah, but if you're signed in, it redirects to zendesk
if you're not signed in, it redirects to beta signin page
(rdcry)
What does it have to do with ssl though?  after signing in to beta.moovweb.com, I'm not using ssl, neither is zendesk.
I see, so because we want/need ssl on our help site, we can't cname help.moovweb.com unless we pay mad moneys.  But we're currently not using ssl in zendesk.
Hmm
only if you're not signed in.
well
Let me check the request once you're signed in...
coolio
cool
@tarun do you know where chrome saves cookies?
Nope, that's android :p
In the filesystem I mean
nvm, I ask the googs
sad face, encryption.
dawgs?  You mean the *ug word, right?
Hmm, not sure if people payed attention
Maybe you should @ all it again to make sure everyone knows.
better safe than sorry :p
We made that function, just for you.
Also
Yes...that is correct...you want more?
MOAR mixers?
So here's the funny thing about mixers...we only want to make new mixers if the mixer definitions change.
As long as those don't change, it would be superflous to make more mixers.
However, finding out whether the definitions changed has become somewhat tricky
Before we just checked for changes in ambrosia
But now everything is in tritium
so we have to check for changes in specific tritium directories as opposed to the tritium repo
and as far as I know, that's tricky to do in jenkins, though I haven't researched that much yet.
So as of right now, ambrosia is still being used, but it looks like it might be deprecated, so all that stuff is still up in the air.
Hence why there's no new mixers.
excellent
Gets the Aaron seal of approval
Hey @AaronLeung, is there a reason why moovweb/libsass does a git checkout -f, then a pull instead of just the pull?
Yeah, that's why it does the pull, but I don't understand the checkout -f part.
Sorry, didn't check the history, I just assumed it was you Aaron =x
It wipes your local changes
Yeah, @jaja, it was you : p
whys?
whys jaja?
If you loved it, why would you want to wipe it off the face of the earth?
You crazy.
Oh, I know all about your clean -f -d loves.
what does that do?
I see
oh, fail, we haven't deployed any new mixers to S3 yet.
Let me....get on that.
Oh, yes, that would be it
@hcatlin do we want to put the mixers in S3?  That would make them publicly available to anyone with the link.
Unless we guard it under some aws auth
@hcatlin did you see my previous posts?
okie doke
I also deployed 0.1.14
have fun!
Deploying is still a manual kick off, so let me know if you need me to deploy any more.
It's always moscato chugging time.
Yup
So far, that's untested.
But I assume it will be fine.
Yeah, that's fine I assume, I doubt there's any differences that would break our stuff.
But as far as building is concerned, we do all our building with go1.0.1
*for deployment that is
I gave edit access to the doc to everyone in Platform, feel free to contribute if you find that it's missing something.
Yeah, icu4c and libxml2 take the longest, but it's still under a couple of minutes.
@hcatlin Did anything change in apollo recently regarding auth?
yeah
Yessssssssssssssssssssss...
powermoov has all the goodies, so yes.
oh, true that, I should add that to the prereq
I like to be thorough :p
that's fine, it's just warnings
lol
I should fix that
but just run ./powermoov
without commands
to see everything
I put mine in $HOME/bin
but it's a matter of preference.
ubuntu will add $HOME/bin to your path if it exists.
There, I fixed the help command :p
do a pulls
Sad face.
@TarunDesikan fixed the help message.  Should be in the latest commit if you pull
@sean --slugurl=http://slug01-int --kvserver=giedi01-int
Hmm, @jaja what exactly would be an example use case for that?
Hmm
@sean, you there?
@AaronLeung Exactly.
@all does manhattanserver.gem need 32 bit as well as 64 bit linux? Or just 64bit?
bow chicka bow-wow
that's what my baby said

chicka chicka chew-wop

gitchee gitchee goo means that I love you
@JoseEspinosa fyi I'm moving your download module into apollo
Zhigang, do you want me to make a jenkins job for the simple mixer?
kk
@ZhigangChen2 The ambrosia transformer tests are failing because the test file has compile time errors.
Please fix, kthnxbye
Make sure you run against the latest version of tritium/master and manhattan/master
to repro locally that is.
ahhh
Nah
Merge whenever you're ready
Just keep in mind the mixer job will fail until you merge
but I think that's fine.
Ok, then go ahead
*high five*
oh...you just left the room.
*high fives self*
I'm game, can we just show up?
or do we have to rsvp somewhere?
yup

well, regardless, I'll check it, thanks
I remember asking about this a while back, I thought we decided small was fine (back then)
Boo?
Boo boo?

Daemonizing...
it's serious stuffs.

@HariAnanth Here's an example on how both the signal handler and the crash handler are registered for powermoov:

You'll have to do this for all the different targets
powermoov, servermoov, stdmoov
Not mps though

odd
I always thought stylesheets failed silently.
Did the browser give you an error or was it our binary?

@JajaB http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpS7nCweYZI
@AaronLeung I assigned you another issue to validate, it's pretty simple.  It was assigned to me, but I'm the one who fixed it, so I figured it was probably best for someone else to validate it.
lol
@all I will be restarting jenkins soon.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTZctTG6cE
Thanks Juan!
/me yay

(rdcry)
@JoseEspinosa What do you need?
stdmoov = moov
stdmoov is our dev-speak for it
Yup, under mac os x instructions I believe
Yes, we support brew for sdk
yup yup
so...Is that the URL I should compile project slugs with from now on?
ok, let me know when you want me to update it.
I think there's an issue filed for Hampton to change the brew recipe to use ~/.moovweb instead of ~/.manhattan
Otherwise, you can use the same one that's on the apollo site, just change the URL for the tar.gz
Are you looking for build 724?  I can set one up on my dropbox
btw, for those interested, this is the link that was in my Tuesday's status:
http://i.qkme.me/3q4lvd.jpg
Also, I spilled a bunch of tea all over my keyboard, and in the process of cleaning it out, my v key broke =(
@JoseEspinosa My filters in gmail:
We should be...
project upgrade you mean?
or mixer upgrade?
mixer upgrade never downloaded the mixer
mixer upgrade no
project upgrade...shouldn't either.
only when you run server.
or something that *needs* it
yup
@jaja, yeah, we probably should.
moov the 3.4 stuff in master over to release_3.4 branch
I'll get around to it eventually.
lol
Thanks for the ticket @JajaB :p
also
so for all builds that took place when chris updated it, it would incorrectly SCP the binaries and installers to the old jenkins box :p
but we can ssh into its private IP just fine
So I updated the etc/hosts file.
for the new IP
as a temp solution
Yeah...so now I'm rsyncing all the builds from yesterday to the new jenkins :p
Not that I know of.
and puppet doesn't touch windows, huh?
heh
@SeanJ  I'm going to try to get to all of mine today, but I probably won't finish until late tonight.  Here's my list:

what do you mean?
I'm only doing the ones that are assigned to me :p
Also, I'm not going to be here Friday, so I'd like to get these done slightly faster =x
Yeah, I won't get to do installers friday
@JoseEspinosa I can answer questions about issue 590 if you still have some
Sorry that took a while btw, they founds a cavity =(
NEVAR
Moscato4life
legit
how can I check staging?
Did you send out that video?
k, let me take a look at the video to get acquainted with it first.
k
ok
k, I see the problem, I'll look into it.
Hmm
Trying to get manhattanserver 3.5.749 gem from http://gems.moovweb.org but it told me it couldn't find it
Were you able to grab it from there?
Wow, I'm silly, forgot the -s flag
w00!
@SeanJ What's the staging machine?  Can I ssh into it and play around in there?  I can't repro locally.
Nope, what's a sandbox that I can play in?
k, I'll try sandbox01
is sandbox01 not 64 bit?
If it's not, that's a problem, manhattanserver gem only contains 64 bit binary and libs
should be easy enough to check, I'll take a look
yup
slaves*
err
Creating a  mixer should be project independent.
ah, ok.
What's that host that we're supposed to use as a gateway?
westpush.moovweb.something?
Well, I don't have access to sandbox01 directly
No lighthouse?
it's fine.
Well, I can get into nosandbox01 from westpush, so I'll play around there in the mean time.
sigh
installing rvm/ruby in nosandbox takes forever (rdcry)
What I meant was, the issue was request that moovweb contain the compile command in order to upgrade a project, and you mentioned that it's not necessary since we have project upgrade, and compile should not be exposed externally.
Therefore, there's nothing to do for that ticket.
hence, it's mute.
Am I using the word mute correctly?
Gotta look it up now...
I would prefer to close that issue and reopen a new one.
But whatever works.
Also
I was thinking of "moot"
You can always edit the title
I guess I just like keeping a log of everything :p
And when you edit stuff, you don't see what it used to be.
Run the mixer-deploy task
Once that succeeds, you have to bug hampton to update it in apollo
Finally, if you want this to be the version that people get when they run mixer upgrade on a legacy project
you need to change the hardcoded value in that command
yeah
LOL
omg
I'm so
silly
@SeanJ You're silly too
git push <tag> failed? 0.o
(rdcry)
Looks like it was git push
on the tag
Let me try to do it manually
But yeah, @SeanJ I figured out what was wrong
with staging
You were being a silly goose.
You were calling the binary directly
instead of the wrapper ruby script
silly you
http://shoparteffect.com/assets/images/AET05101.jpg
Oh?
weird
Looks like it
from the path
yup
Well the odd thing is
I never changed the location of the ruby wrapper script for the gem
It's always been the same
which means
that ops has *always* been calling the binary directly.
The only thing we really need is the LD_LIB path and also the daemonizing
the wrapper script does both of those things.
But the command you sent in the email doesn't even pass the daemonizing flag
I don't know where you got that command
But a whle back I asked Juan for the command that runs, and he gave me this:
This is the correct command.
Or at least what I made sure worked.
I got the above command from Juan a week or so ago.
No...nosandbox is still installing rvm/ruby -.-
But based on the path in the email, it makes total sense.
k
Seems like it.
Okie doke
Sure thing
FYI
I checked fmljewlers in nosandbox
using the command I mentioned above
works like a charm
<3 when things work
yeah, reverting...
Reverted...
Dog! I've been meaning to talk to you!
Ok...I'm going to work on the new issues that I got assigned, and also validate the ones that I need to validate.
Not sure if I'll get to do many project testing today, maybe one or two =(
yep yep
heh, I need to slow down :p
Shouldn't the host_map.js file be re-generated on every call to moov server as opposed to project upgrade?
So why do we need it in project upgrade?
Well
I thought host_map.js was a non-checked in file
so I don't understand why they would ever need to worry about it
if it's only used when we run the server anyways
The issue is....>.>...........moot?
quite
┌─┐\n┴─┴\nಠ_ರೃ
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
Then when I fix something, i label it Validate and assign it to someone else (usually you) :p
Yeah, I verbally mentioned the fix to the email, but not sure if people listened :p
That's fine, though I don't mind sending the new links, so I'm fine including them unless you specifically don't want me to.
Yeah, I'll continue on the same thread then.  The original?
Ok, on the next prerelease I'll also amend the instructions to make sure everyone is clear on what validate and QA-3.5.xxx means.
Yeah, i was planning on doing them every morning
Hmm, do we have an ETA for his change?
Ok, then his prerelease can be for Friday morning.
Also, I wanted to ask.
Are we going to parallelize fixing issues as well as testing on customer projects?
The guide says to serialize them
but it sounds like we're going to be doing both.
Ok
True, ok
btw
Hmm, reminds of the Black Swan
Yeah
Perhaps it might be worthwhile having people dedicated for testing, and people dedicated for fixing issues instead of having everyone do everything?  Or do you think that would bottleneck?
Fair enough
yeah, that's true.
Sounds good
What crazy behaviour are you seeing?  Cause my server dies after it can't bind to the port.
Or rather, how are you getting that crazy behavior to show up.
:p
Another moot!
?
I have problems like that with gmail all the time -- 'tis why I turned off keyboard shortcuts there :p
Lemme take a look at his emamil
No, that's fine
The script that he listed is the correct command that works
I wanted to keep them open
And only close them once we settle on a version, and then do a final round of verification
on that version
to make sure that something that we verified in 715 did not regress by the time we got to 800
Right, not each round, only at the end
Ok, that's fine.
I'll add that to the new instructions
Sounds good
build jobs are failing, at least until we get some more space.  I filed a ticket in lighthouse to get some.   Hopefully by tomorrow morning we should be good.
http://afkrpg.com/
@MichaelCatlin yup
okie dokes.
@AaronLeung grab me whenever you need me.
okie dokes
Hmm, are you sure?  I thought I put them in tmp/messages
What manhattan version are you using?
Odd, yeah, the default should be <project dir>/tmp/messages
=)
why, is that not working?
Hmm
That's because you guys decided to roll your own subcommand parsing instead of using what I had already implemented :p
lol
Just make a ticket to fix it and assign it to me, it's slightly more complicated since we don't actually try to parse flags for moov project and moov mixer
We only start parsing flags on the third subcommand level.
so it would require some special handling
But this gives me an excuse to clean that code up =)
alrighty
w00ts.
Success.
I can't, whenever I try to buy now, it tells me that my cart is empty and links me to continue shopping

@HariAnanth Take a look at Jaja's stuff up there.
...So what is the spirit of what you're trying to do?
I rather have no free dinner than free dinner that is supposed to guilt me into staying in later than usual =(
...as long as you stay longer after you finish eating?
That's the question...
If I'm done with my work at 7pm, and dinner is about to be served, can I stay for dinner and then go home?
But you said you would hunt me down =(
ha
A lot of times I end up finishing roughly around 7pm
In fact, I'd say my average time that I leave the office is between 7 and 7:30pm
BUT, my apartment has a kitchen.
Will I have to beware the wrath of Tarun's man hunt, or can I sleep soundly tonight?
wowowowowow
no one said anything about lunch
hold the phone
hold all the phones
BEDS?!
If I move into the office, does that count as an apartment without a kitchen?
I prefer mattresses stuffed with clouds and angel feathres.
...so that I can taste them in my sleep.

sad, no icon
@hcatlin knows for sure
yes
oh man, that lunch looks delicious.
So sads I missed out =(
If there are leftovers, i'll totally be over that tomorrow :p
nice, thanks!
hahaha
We'll see what happens
I could probably use the sleep anyways :p
I'm more worried about laxatives :p
i'm looking at the code for the slug map in mps, and it looks like we might not have to do anything actually
There's only one go routine that writes on the map
all other go routines just read from it
Which explains why it never broke before.
Yeah
The code confused me a bit
right
and it writes to it
oh wait
hold on, I was thinking of the updater routine vs the request routine, I forgot that we could get multiple routines coming in at once.
there's one go routine that goes through all the slugs in the map and updates them
that guy is actually only doing reads on the map, -- the map contains a 'project' struct which has a field for a slug, so the updater routine just updates the slug field in the same project struct, so there are no writes to the map there.
So it should be enough to synchronize our writes when a request comes in.
right
just in the one place where we write to it though.
So we don't need a read/write lock for the entire thing, we could just stick a mutex when we put something in.
line 55 on /targets/mps/manager.go
I believe
I suppose you're right.
We should do the safest thing now, and try messing with it later on 3.7 when we have more time to play around with it.
Sure, I'll assign the validation to you.
git fetch office sandwich && git checkout plate && git merge sandwich && git push home

ha
hm
Would that work?
Hmm, you could check whether the bundle files are created or not.
neato
is that gonna be an apollo api feature?
I tried making the change in the macys tritium myself, but ended up with an ugly error message =x
I figured I just don't know how to use tritium, was wondering if you could show me how to do a proper fix using Sean's function.
Basically I did this:
$desktop_link {\n           replace($desktop_link, proxy_to_upstream($desktop_link))\n           append($path)\n           append($mobileblock)\n         }
And then everything freaked out.
That's the outpu tI got.
yup
yeah, looks that way...
Yeah, i just finished an ack
Wasn't sure if the function was added in tritium or somewhere else though
yup, not there
This sounds like new github issue material.
Is tritium tester setup to use the simple-mobile mixer?
yep
what's the url for tritium tester?
just for general knowledge
also, @JajaB there is a javascript function for it, but there should also be a tritium one.
like poking a bunny?
I punch my pillows to fluff them :p
also
the "Show tritium spec" link is broken =(
Flat and bready
Perhaps we should file an issue for it :p
If we're opening it to the public, we probably want it fixed.
If there's an issue already for it, we should assign it to someone
And stick it in Rl-35.
Yeah, that seems right
probably beta instead of apollo
(allthethings)
Ok, I'm fixing it :p
Not before filing an issue!
It takes a second, it's a hard coded link
but yeah, filing an issue is way too much overhead for the fix, too lazy...I'll just fix it :p
there, all done
Next deploy of it should have the updated URL
Github is getting friendlier with its error messages
(>.<) : master : /home/noj/dev/apollo $ git pull\nERROR: Storage server temporarily offline. See http://status.github.com for GitHub system status.\nfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Hmm
@JajaB and @ChrisMague would be the people to ask about that.
@AaronLeung Because the monkey holding it died.
@AaronLeung did I get it right?
i win!
I think that owes me at least one carlton d a n c e.
Anyone disagree?
Unanimous then!  Let's dance the sickness away!
yep
You should watch some fresh prince of bel-air
http: //www.imdb.com/title/tt0098800/
Yup yup
lol
clever
You could also just delete them from the page : p
yup yup
so you're saying it doesn't like prefixes with a number on them?
K, michael is talking about a different issue thouhg
Could you do this with moov 3.4.156?
Or was it always the case that our rewriter broke with a numbered prefix.
but that's m.www1.1800flowers, right?
not mwww1.1800flowers
so the prefix there is still just "m"
*I think*
Yeah, this is the 1800 flowers page:   http: //m.ww31.1800flowers.com/
What moov are you using @MichaelCatlin?
oh, ok, so if it doesn't work there, I'm assuming it never worked.
@SeanJ or @JajaB might be able to verify that, or offer a better explanation to what's going on in the code internals.
For new projects in 3.5, they should be using the new host map as opposed to rewriters, so it'll be a completely different code path
Yup, I believe so
hostVar (which is the prefix) should be able to be anything.
@ZhigangChen2 can offer more details on that one.
Yeah, there's no flag to tell manhattan to use a local apollo right now, so you'll have to edit etc/hosts probably
yeah
that's correct
the stats endpoint is not yet implemented in apollo as far as I know
You should  be able to see the requests in the apollo logs
no?
ah
Other than changing the code, how do you configure the stats to report locally?
Yeah, that's what we were talking about.
Yup, that's what sean is going through now : p
Brings up an interesting point though
someone could run moov server, let it auth, and then set their /etc/hosts to point apollo to localhost
and then we don't get stats =(
lol
lol, that would be nice
Ham bot, you so cray cray
I think the keyword there was r u l e s
Given the two conf files you linked, would it be enough to start nginx and just point it to the ssl.conf file?  Or is there more to it?
Mine doesn't like "server" : p
I'm running 1.2.1
I see, so I was doing it wrong, : p
I see
I just had a default file which looked like a mock up config of a generic server
Hmm
I *think* I got mine working locally.
yep
Nope, I broke it...
I don't think nginx is doing anything
Yeah, duplicate mime type
in a conf
yep
it seemed like the right thing to do at the time :p
nope, I figured I wouldn't need nginx again, so I didn't bother backing up
okie dokie
You mean the one you linked?
:p
k
Hmm
Doesn't seem to be working
nope
Nope, cause I'm a newb.
wait
no, it's fine.
oh
it should be 3000
yay
it works
ok
Well, that was a nice excercise.
@SeanJ do you want me to validate that ticket since I have the setup now?
:p
yellow error?
o.0
...cool I suppose
gg
I don't know what it would be on mac.
Hmm, still want me to verify theN?
okie dokes
Ok.
yeah, the stats handle is not installed yet
yeah, i see that
I had to change the config/routes.rb file to add a route rule for stats
Nope, just did it locally
There should be an issue filed under apollo for hampton to create the real handle.
Cool
Mine just did puts params :p
Still need to see it in the console since these requests are being made by the moov binary :p
Though the render makes the page not crash, so that makes me happy =)
Where in gods earth did I mention the forbidden "d" word
are you kidding?
yay
You beat me to it :p
I was too busy being upset at hambot
(gtfo) @HamBot
I think this was specifically to make sure that apollo received them.
yeah!
that's the one you verified :p
like, totally
Wrapped that mother up in a mutex, never spoke again.
yeah
Actually
We shouldn't.  The mutex is only around the start of the collecting, not the actual collecting.
Slapped it in the behind, and told it to go home to momma
I actually used a mutex for it, but I recently learned of this:
http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Once
Which would've achieved the same thing.
Yeah, pretty neat
that's ridiculous
assert_your_mommas_so_fat
ouch
harsh
True
is there something like
asset_yo_mommas_so_fast :expected => false
assert_yo_mommas_not_so_fat
nifty
Hmm, nevermind, looks like it was automagically mooved 0.0
coolio
ok
I'm planning on it, but if I'm still coughing all over the place, I'd rather spare you guys the carnage.
But I expect to be in tomorrow.
If it's still kind of bad, I'll probably just drink some robitussin and man up at that point :p
did you guys start the install packages qa yet?
k
okie dokes
cool
looks like we're practically done
@SeanJ what sdk version are you using for moov compile?
bump
refresh
I'm waiting for the avengers
and also kung fu panda 2
Thor is in netflix right now as well I believe
He seemed familiar
I thought susan storm was supposed to be blonde
WELSH?!?
You odn't say.
Is that so?
The guy with the whistle?
I LOVE THAT GUY
He had a flash light and everything
guy was a baller
saving lives and shit, like no ones business.
He didn't give a fuck, no phones?  screw that, I'll yell from the top of my lungs.  No flash lights?  Fuck it, I'll invent one on the spot.
Actually
$ could be anything
not just something prefixed with "m"
=/
also
you should wait before merging
yeah
golog is fine
but the log stuff in manhattan
Yeah, wait until we branch out 3.5
then you can merge it on master which would be 3.6
Hmm, the build looks like it's broken because of some silly git issues, let me try clearning the workspace
Hmm
When we generate it, we should make sure that we do it in a way that go fmt likes it.
I'll make that change.
Yeah, but it shouldn't be a conflict, it should just be locally modified file.
Yep
lol, too bad, I just fixed it :p
And it would only matter if the person breaking it has go fmt set to automatically run on saving anyways :p
what's -w?
ah
YES
ha
Hey @JajaB where is the mixer version hard coded in project upgrade
From what I can tell, it's just calling mixer upgrade on it
but that should upgrade to the latest version (rather than the legacy version).
Hmmm
Yeah, probably, since we want it to be a legacy Mixer.lock file
or rather
one that will work for legacy projects.
a static one.
Hmm, I can go head and change it to write a static one.
Should be omni, but I'll talk to sean about it anyways
Since this sort of changes the behavior of project upgrade a bit.
oh no
the windows build is failing =(
looks like an icu4c error.
you know what
I just wiped the workspace
so it's possible it had trouble creating it at first, let's try kicking another run and seeing if it likes it then.
Yeah, not sure why
so it should be fine for windows too...not sure why it would complain
Hmmm
odd
it shouldn't...
Should be part of the normal icu4c crowd.
yeah, failed again, same issue
Hmm, let me check if icuin is on the other jenkins box
Yeah, let's try that.
right, because of the github catastrophe
Ok, sounds good, this should solve it then.
Interesting
oh yeah, I got an email about that :p
They were super quick to fix it =)
But, speaking on windows build, I got this error message when trying to wipe the workspace (the second time)
You think windows is trying to delete the root files of the link?
yeah, just remove the link
although, also check that all the clibs are there in userContent...I have a feeling that wiping the workspace might've deleted some of them =/
If we have to rebuild all the clibs, then so be it.  Probably best to do so anyways.
lol
I see
well, icu4c is done
should I try wiping the workspace again?
k, this might take a while since it has to reclone everything.
Alrighty.  Time to lay back and chill for a bit :p
cool
Well, after we branch, you can put new 3.6 features in master
but for now, yes, please use the new branch
ok
master branch in all projects are open for checkin
feel free to check in your 3.6 features on the master branch
I'll send out an email
Hey, @JajaB
Some gokogiri tests seem to be randomly failing on windows
I was gonna debug them, but noticed that I can't log in to the windows box anymore =(
did the password change recently?
ok, nvm, got it
Nope
well
as of right now, it's 1.0.110
oh
for simple mobile is the same
Yeah, I got the same error
Zhigang needs to fix something in the ambrosia
then we'll make a new mixer
and then hopefully that'll work.
in the mean time

It was funny
And then it got twisted
but still funny
:p
Not for the commonfolk
only for us internal special people.
The pawns get no compile.
@all do most mobile browsers render compressed images fine?
k
well, we could send them over gzipped
I'm assuming that's what compression means.
I could avoid compressing pngs
compression is per content type
Yeah, I got those listed.
k
I'll do text/js/css for now then.
@ZhigangChen2 cloudfront dns:  d1topzp4nao5hp.cloudfront.net
What do you need us to do?
should we siege it?
k
Lets see
man, ilt's super slow
yeah
I chuckled
I'm still waiting to see my swim suit models....
Gah, engine timeout -.-
@ZhigangChen2 mdev.www1.macys.com.slug
Yeah, no worries.
That is epic
And worth dancing over
Hey @ZhigangChen2 , what's going on in this line:
conn.(*tls.Conn).Handshake()
manhattan
yep
There's at least three episodes
oh
Hmm
What site?
And you go to mlocal.blah on your ios device
and it redirects you to m.blah?
that probably means the brew is messed up =(
I think reinstall should fix it....but before you try that, did you do anything funky lately that might've broke it?
wait a minute
I see
that's running from the gem
that's weird
how did you install the gem?
oh
@HariAnanth I got this error message after hard killing an instance of moov server and trying to start another one
ERROR:  Sorry, port 80 is already in use by another instance of `moov server` and is not available for the proxy port. Please end this process before attempting to start another instance.
Is there a temp file I need to clean up?
Cool kids use playgrounds
http://play.golang.org/p/DVWsrHwM1D
@AaronLeung Ok, should be in the next build
So just grab the debian package from the next coming build, and it should be in.
yes
wait
no
it doesn't matter what the yaml file is called
it creates config.json out of *all* the yaml files
in the config dir.
You need to get the right key
how does your yaml look like?
Yeah, that's the wrong part
The key is not rules
the key is "host_map"
You have to do
Consult with Sean to be sure.  I know host_map works, but maybe we're supposed to change it to Rules, I don't know
what doc were you looking at?
@hcatlin Why so mad the gems =(
@all brew install link:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/moovweb.rb
That will give you version 3.6.56
Sure
@JajaB Should be deployed
@hcatlin the register_version handle in apollo doesn't exist anymore.  What should we use for registering a new version of manhattan?
er
moovweb
yums
(yay)
=(
(flutteryay)
Nope
I haven't touched apollo
I could if you want me to.
Let me take a looksy and see how it looks like
coolio
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/pugme.jpg
Best experience of my life.
I do
I have returned.
He was very apologetic
I was just happy that he didn't lie to me about losing the check.  He could've very easily just told me that he never got it.
Just because of that, I figured I'd be nice to him and just send him a new one no questions asked =p
Yup
back to QAing!
@hcatlin can I remove the git installer from the windows installer?
It's causing a lot of errors =(
And we can always tell people to install it from the git website as a pre-req or post-req if we really want it.
We probably won't get a response till tomorrow, he's probably resting.
=(
In the mean time I'll work on hiding the user input when inputting your user/pass for apollo in windows :p
http://twitter.com/caughtpoopin
It's causing installation issues.
We looked into it for now, and it seems that they're common issues when trying to embed the git installer
@ZhigangChen2 do you have that link you showed me?
Anyways, we could look into how to do it properly on 3.7, but for 3.6, it's probably cleaner to just link users to the link installer in our installation instructions.
If you think this is top priority
I can spend more time on investigating this
and trying to get it to work.
I can spend some more time investigating
How about I spend the rest of today looking into how to make it a cleaner install
and if we're still having issue by tomorrow, then we nix it?
mac one click installer is set for 3.7 right now
You can talk to sean about re-prioritizing it
But I mentioned this to Tarun before, for mac, you literary just have to untar it and it's ready to go
Yeah, no other package cares about git
Do you want to prevent users from running moov if git is not installed?
Detecting whether the user has git seems like it would be difficult
oh
I thought moov generate would just get a zip file from apollo and we'd unpack it.
Ok
So we should add git checks on all the installers...
It's build.sh actually
make sure you do a pull :p
It should, yes.  Let me kick off another build to make sure.
I kicked off another build, but it looks like it's a real failure.  I checked the windows box and the libsass.dll file it has was created today, so it's definitely fresh.
@hcatlin I removed the git installer, we couldn't get rid of the error messages =(
@hcatlin we added the git installer back :p
ping
pong
windows
so many windows
3 monkeys die every time you watch carlton dance.
We're going to branch twice
once for 3.6, and once for 4.0
I think it's already deployed.
@HariAnanth is that correct?
k
yeah, it's assigned to me
@ZhigangChen2 manhattan
I'll try to be more specific of where these changes need to go in the issues.
@HariAnanth moov generate --project-name="poopin" --base-domain="poopinrules.com"
poopin fails
apollo is fucked
I can't delete a project
and I can't git clone projects
I want to cry.
or poop
but i can't
cause apollo won't let me

It's ok
it's all apollo issues
talked to Tarun and Hampton
Looks like it might be gitolite issues, Josh is supposed to change the api hooks to not use gitolite tomorrow, so hopefully it'll be fixed with that.
Yeah, that's what I got earlier.
http://i.qkme.me/3qhitf.jpg
Isn't that what message queues accomplish?  Synchronous programming in an asynchronous world?
also, when brown is in town, shit will go down.
(poo)
how does it work now?
Does each request kick off gitolite right now?
does the config change?
If it's read-only, should be fine, no?
Nope, you should have the base template
ew
and we DONT have synchronization on that?
that sounds terrible.
@ZhigangChen2 Yeah, moov generate wasn't working for me either.
@JajaB hampton said he had an easy solution, what was his concept compared to this?
What do you mean by opening it to everyone?
Hmmm, right now its
So the race condition is something that hasn't even been exploited yet, but could be
Our current issues are caused by something else.
sadface
I don't understand
why we need such a heavy weight (or at least what sounds like a heavy weight) that is gitolite
didn't you write your own little git server in like 10 lines of code?
I see
ha, nice
Yeah, though I'm surprised that it needs to be that complicated.  I guess I just don't fully understand the requirements.
gnight
Right now when you click the "Finish" button in the exe bundle it'll open up a browser which will direct you to the git download page which should automatically start the git download for you.
yep yep
yeah
shoudl only appear the first time you run it
subsequent runs should not complain
@SeanJ 4.0.1 should be ready to be deployed
@HariAnanth http://trust.salesforce.com/trust/status/
@HariAnanth http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/1948/self-defense-from-derrickcomedy
It's all about wrist control
Yeah
I would've traded the gun for a spoon,.
That's how real men do it.
No you didn't, must be a local hipchat issue
refresh your thingy
Excellent
OH MAN
POW
KABLAM
it was
we had at least 5 or six people
no one should be using internal mixers
they're just the components that build the external ones
how come?
hellz yea
You're missing out
It's a party
I'm doing handstands and shit
Yep
We extended Yuliya's farewell to include the entire day
yep yep
Hmm
File a github issue
I'll look into it
I'll get on that right after this, we just finished manhattan generator issues
also
what version of plutonium do you want in the generator templates?
I noticed the latest is 0.1.70
68 looks like it had a fix to a redirect loop
k, I'll do 68 since that's as far as our spreadsheet goes to
@SeanJ I commented on the header issue
Looks like it's not a regression, but a feature change :p
I believe Josh is the one that actually implemented it, but I don't know who requested, but personally I find it good to separate our proxy version from their project version.
That way we can provide more info without looking too cluttered.
X-S-V gives us the account, project, and version
(in mps, that would be the actual account, in moov production, we just set it to whatever we want)
k
before closing the issue, do you want me to change the account to moovweb?
(instead of 'local')
It makes more sense to set it to moovweb, I'll go ahead and do it unless you'd rather set it to something else?  "local" is the default we set it to for people running locally and we just forgot to override it on the production command.
yeah, that should be fine
it's the same thing
Nope
If there is a different, something went terribly wrong.

spilled some stuff on my keyboard
was trying to clean it up :p
ok
someone is fucking with jenkins
anyone wanna fess up?
I'm talking to @all of you
hrmrmrmrmrm
Well, the deploy you kicked off failed on running genit
I would just deploy again
>.<
like 5 minutes ago
well, fien
fine
I'll just create a new one now
but seriously
whoever is deleting jobs
stop it
We need to add test cases for things like these.
Yeah, but from the looks of it, is not like someone thought of removing that info from the header
it seems like the info was just lost during the refactor.
I understand that, but I what I'm saying is that sometimes these things slip by even though you've thought about it.  Having test cases can only help in this scenario.
Of course.  tests are not an excuse to not think bout the changes you're making, I think that's clear.
Sorry, was in a meeting
I replied to the issue
The generator had a bug in it, Hampton fixed it this morning
You should check again.
Also, the build box is updated
to handle the multiple domains
everything is good to go
hermrm
@AaronLeung what template are you generating?
The default template doesn't contain _uranium by default :p
try generating the mobile template
that one has it.
@SeanJ everything should be good to go
do a moov help generate
Sorry about the tardyness, was in a meeting
Are we deploying apollo soon?
This is very exciting ^.^
(soawesome)
I guess it's too late to deploy apollo today? =(
We discussed our plans for 3.7 is all.
I'll create a bunch of github issues describing them.
no worries
you should close the issue =D
We're really close to having all issues closed in 3.6 (soawesome)
okie dokie lokie
I noticed @hcatlin asked me to trigger a build a while back, I'm assuming that's the build you triggered @SeanJ ?
Sorry about being so MIA on hipchat today
k
yes
moov help generate (or moov generate --help)
You shouldn't have to, it should be sanitized
Well
the smallest port would be
401
yeah
true
Hmm
Yeah, you might want to sanitize
mabe prepend a number if it's less than 4 digits
That should be enough I think
ok
so if it's not the initial commit, the user is correct
but the initial commit (if using moov generate) is hampton
Considering that it's the build box making the commit, that makes sense
but rather than making hampton the user, could we at least call it "moovcloud" or something?  I guess this is a question for ops
ports
?
yeah
@HariAnanth is your change in?
I'm about to push to master and release_4.0 :p
oh well, I guess it'll fail then.
lol
You might be better off having a config.json.tmp that you give to sed and have sed output config.json
No, you'll have a stale config.json
so you might want to remove it beforehand
for apollo?
oh, you mean sdk
yeah, --flag and -flag are the same
use whichever you fancy
@SeanJ Silver chains are even better!  Less pretentious but still classy :p
@MichaelCatlin Here's the link, I'll let you know when it's done syncing
(flutteryay)
So could you test out the stuff that broke libsass/spracker before and make sure it's ok now?
coolio
if you're using the gem
moov is the ruby wrapper that calls stdmoov
if you are using debian/brew
moov is the shell wrapper that calls stdmoov
no
the binary name is stdmoov
in all cases
yeah
sorry
in the gem the binary is moov
and the ruby wrapper is also moov
I think, let me check
Hmm
we could
but it will mean changing the packaging scripts
yeah
it did
I believe the reason why we chose to keep the name was to make it clear which version you were using
huh?
I mean, we can just call stdmoov moov
and call it a day
no
Sean wanted moov version to return a clean version number
it helps with scripting
I say
just rename stdmoov to moov
that's what we distribute
everyone is happy
powermoov is still powermoov, servermoov is still servermoov
but those are internal only
and helps us know what we're running
reasonable?
@SeanJ @hcatlin sound good?
If you're running the stuff we distrubute publicly, yes
If you're running internal stuff, it might say powermoov, moov, or servermoov depending on which package you run : p
I think that's a user permission issue
if you're running in sudo, I don't think there's a way for us to know what you're other usename is to chown it to that.
is there?
@MichaelCatlin try removing it locally and generating a project, if anything breaks, add it back : p
I shows you in a second
also, @ZhigangChen2
that seems silly
if anything, we should do 666
I think right now we're doing 655
So if we change the perms to 666, the file can be removed by a normal user even if it was created by sudo?
lemme try it
yeayh
did the min change to 3 instead of 4?
@SeanJ a lot of links on accenture redirect you to the desktop site
http://mnosaka.accenture.com/us-en/technology/global-delivery/Pages/index.aspx
I *think* this might be because of the www rule issue
but I'm not certain
okie dokes.
@TarunDesikan I'll look into the dropped upstream issue
In that case, go ahead and make a github issue if you still haven't figured it out with repro steps and we'll get to it eventually.
excellent
@AaronLeung can you help Naseem with his gosass error?
@JoseEspinosa Looks good
@JoseEspinosa instead of "the user" say "Make sure you have..."
/is taking a nap, please text/call him to wake him up if he doesn't respond and you need him
lame
/me is taking a nap, please text/call him to wake him up if he doesn't respond and you need him
/me woke up, everyone rejoice!
@HariAnanth sudo chgrp root hosts
oh, also, if we haven't talked about it, we should talk about the warnings in bourbon
we could
or we could delete the reference of them in the default projects
and if the user decides to use them
he'll get the warnings
that's another option
indeedy doo
coo
@JajaB mmdayaram474.mlp.wikia.com
@JajaB is there any way I can get the apollo gem?
that was deployed?
hey @MichaelCatlin
lovely day, wouldn't you say?
redo what?
er, what about it?
thankee again!
@JajaB https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/107234017478509748854/albums/5766352306119252657/5781832754413734370?authkey=CN2etNK4x_2BUA
cool
Hmm, not I
@hcatlin sticky note #1 is not mine
Should only be the first time
DANCE
beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
bees
wrong emo
http://emo.hazasite.net
@JajaB how does git know which ssh key to use when doing a git push?
or rather, when you made moov login, you give the user a choice of which key to upload to apollo
Hmmm
ok, I'll test it out, maybe ssh just takes care of that stuff for us.
great
that's all fine and dandy
but I"m assumming we're not setting that up when the user calls moov login
Hmm, cause the user coudl do a moov login, pick some random key that's not id_rsa, and then when you do a git push, git will use id_rsa by default unless they specify it themselves, no?
From the description, it looks like it tries id_rsa by default, and that's that, but I'm gonna try it out right now and see what I get.
so if you have millions of keys...it just tries all of them..that's crazy.
sounds good, ok, good, phew
@NaseemMakiya http://theoatmeal.com/quiz/sriracha_addict

@SeanJ I'm gonna file a lighthouse ticket to juan to deploy 4.0.88 in the build box.  He probably won't get to it till tomorrow morning, but I figured that's fine.
Unless you'd prefer me to wait?
not mps
this is the buildbox
(only used for moov compile)
k
@MichaelCatlin What's the github link to file issues for the docs?
is that in the moovweb repo?
(indeed)
excellent
@MichaelCatlin You said no videos, right?
What about attached source code?
Would that be updated?
We could get it (from jenkins) if they REALLY need it.
@AaronLeung http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony

ooo?
@HariAnanth still need my help?
I'm up for it if you're up for it
does @HariAnanth still need my help?
soooooooooo
hari, still need my help?

What's the id of the input you're setting the value of?
you need this guy: ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_ImageVideoUpload1_imageUpload
are you making it visible with javascript before hand?
yeah, so you do setAttribute("style", "") or something like that, right?
weird
what language are you doing this in?
no idea
yeah, I dunno
that's weird
it must be a selenium feature
to be able to handle that
however it does
sorry I can't help
I wonder if this link works:  https://dl.dropbox.com/s/6xy88tdntjeegn3/2012-09-07%2013.16.29.jpg?dl=1
It's Friday, what do you think we're up to?

@MatB This video is awesome
@AaronLeung do you have a link to the github issue regarding the libsass crash?
there is, or at least, there should be
here we go
http://cuteoverload.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/20120909-191334.jpg?w=560
I was wondering
Where my "proxy" domain is "noj.com" but I'm proxying "cuteoverload.com"
Yes
could be anything really
cookie name: myfavoritepug
value: joe
value "joe the pug"
sorted?
ah
I see I see

Guys, I think we need to do some pair programming in this house.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBjVTMUQY0
Excellent!  I have Tarun's support.  Make it happen!
@SeanJ Tarun tells me there's a known bug in windows for 4.0.88 where it nil pointers on generate.  There's someone in the support room with this bug, can we give them 4.0.90 to try out?
oh oh
no, that one is fixed
it's probably this one
=(
Mahesh experienced the nil pointer during generate
if you file more, you can get the happy duck punk duck =D
yeah, he wasn
wasn't*
and when I asked him to use it, he signed off =(
omni-mobile is legacy
we want everyone to use simple-mobile
omni-mobile should go extinct after a while.
Hmm
register is not working?
Let me take a look
oh wait
this is in apollo
you guys removed the build_register function?
ah
the description in the github issue sounds like it makes sense
that's probably what's happening
Hmm
so I guess create and generate can't be transactional.
You *need* to do create and persist it for generate to work.
Unless we somehow bypass the build box on generate.
tested it, was autodownloaded successfully.
Should we bump the version in the generator?
(soawesome)
You can just run
moov mixer upgrade
DONE
or if you're super awesome
you can run
vi Mixer.lock
and edit the file yourself to a known mixer
yes, moov mixer upgrade just updates Mixer.lock file to the latest version that apollo knows about
then next time you run it'll auto-download it
that way you don't have to worry about which version number to change it to
Imagine a world where you have dozens of mixers in your mixer.lock file
you want to upgrade all of them to their latest versions
going in there and figuring that out manually, MAN, what a pain.
just use moov mixer upgrade, and upgrade them all at once!
once we have more functionality, we could do things like moov mixer upgrade simple-mobile
or moov mixer upgrade --all
oh man
so cool
we're legit
@SeanJ I posted the links in the github issue
Also git blame points to Zhigang, but it was at the start of the refactor...so it never worked for 4.0
or 3.5 or 3.6 for that matter.
http://howdoiputthisgently.tumblr.com/post/31474141340
@SeanJ can I get that list of versions for the mixers?
thnx
@SeanJ we don't have any tags for the mixer version that start with zero
0.1.etc..
Those are really odd, and it's very doubtful that any one is using them
do you think it would be ok to skip them from the testing?
alternatively, I guess we could track down the hash of the jenkins job for them, though the testing is probably not even accurate that far down.
by accurate, I mean not the same way we do testing now.
k
I'm back!
all my watches are fixed ^.^
/me leaves room
:p
um
not that I know off the top of my head, tcpdump would be the best way.  The most logs you can get from mps is by using the --debug flag when you run it
not sure if the requests/responses show up with that though
you want to see the whole header?
body included?
hah
probably missing that same header we were missing before
content-type: x-form-data or something like that.
yeah, tcpdump would be the easiest way
so
it looks like we log the request info
with a UDP logger
so if you somehow listen to UDP packets sent from mps
you can catch the logs
if you want to do it that way instead
I think so.
haven't tested it out
just browsing the code
Hmm
wait a minute
it should also be logged to console.
oh
here
do this
run mps with the debug flag
and also
that will log the requests to the console
yeah, that should work
--debug flag tells mps to log to console
you have to start mps *after* touching the file
hmm
failsauce
(rdcry)
@all http://pingpong.hazasite.com
It's version one, cause I'm terrible at rails, ruby, and heroku apparently.
that's my domain
haha
yeah, I didn't know what else to use for hcat
Hmm, did not know I needed approval...well, I only posted the link to platform, so he can change it before it's public
@hcatlin just contemplating here, since we don't have any real data, but how many pushes do you expect we'll get to moovcloud every hour?
I'm trying to decide the mps slug update interval
right now it's checking for new slugs every 10 seconds, which is too excessive.
@SeanJ maybe you have opinions about this as well?
sure
ok....v0.0.2
http://pingpong.hazasite.com/
It has the brackets listed, but it's not interactive.
All the database stuff to make it interactive is there, so it shouldn't be too hard now...
but I'm tired
so me le sleep
@TarunDesikan http://pingpong.hazasite.com/matches/serious
It will begin auto-updating tonight.
for now it's just static though
if you don't have libonig already installed, then year

@hcatlin If you have GOPATH set, then it doesn't matter where you run the commands, here's some sample output for go list -json
@MichaelCatlin http://www.hungryfools.com/2008/03/after-2-months-of-extensive-development.html
not sure, @AaronLeung do you know?
mac mini in the closet
when I destroy things, I destroy all the things....
(allthethings)
but no, seriously, I'm sorries.
Yeah, property of moovweb now
only if they were changed
name was too long
we have a regex that matches the repo name and gives access
but the regex only goes up to 21 chars
mague extended it to 25
this should block creation of new projects as well
the only reason H&B was in a bad state is because we only started using the regex last week because of another issue
If you try creating a project longer than that, it'll fail too, since the regex is in place, but yeah, having it in apollo gives us control on better error messaging.
what does the index() function do?
inner("") seems right based on semantics, so you're saying that index() is returning 1?
Hmm
cool
charles proxy?
@MichaelCatlin how can i replace everything in a webpage with something else in tritium?
I used $("/html") { set("stuff") } but it didn't work
oooh, lemme try
cool, that worked, thanks!
hmm
sweet! that's exactly what I wanted.  Doing inner forced me to embed it in <html> but set let's you cover everything, thanks
Hm
make a github issue about it
assign it to Sean
and he'll delegate to whoever actually will do it
Hmmm, do we need this test this week?
then assign it to Sean :p
excellent (indeed)
Should be the same type of argument as insert_at
@func XMLNode.insert_javascript_at(Position %pos, Text %js) {\n  insert_at(%pos, "script") {\n    attribute("type", "text/javascript")\n    cdata(concat("//<![ CDATA[ \n", %js, "\n// ] ]>"))\n    yield()\n  }\n}
takes a Position object?
weird
how do you create a position object in tritium?
so you can do
insert_javascript_at(position("top"), "stuff")
but I don't know what are valid arguements to the position function
cause I can't find where it's defined
but I see it being used everywhere like that.
@AaronLeung why do you always blip in the morning?
I see
Cool, thanks
@hcatlin @MatB should I file a github issue about the git server thingy?
@hcatlin doesn't reply to my messages, he doesn't love me (rdcry)
k
hcatlin/libsass doesn't use autoconf?
Hrmrmrmm
I would rather keep the make file
er
autoconf
it's an industry standards
anyways, if that's taking too long, don't worry about it now
but keep in mind that'll have to get fixed in order to get a build in of libsass
I changed the hipchat emoticon website to use moovweb!
emo.hazasite.com.moovapp.com
Now whenever they update the official emoticons, we'll get the updates too ^.^
I already added a CNAME to my DNS, but it hasn't propogated yet -.-
The third code box
yeah
I was insertting things all over the place
mad pro
/me is super pro at tritium now
(philosoraptor)
I don't believe so
I think that's a feature request though, maybe 4.1?
Lemme search github issues
Some time in november I think
buzz words!
We keep your code hot, so that you don't have to ;)
I smell a promotion video here.
Involving laptops in ovens
in clouds
hahaha
@TarunDesikan Promotion video idea, read above!
made it just now :P
=D
(soawesome)
(flutteryay)
Though, remember to fix the make file stuff =x
ah, thanks
test: http://m.universalweather.com/tripsupport/
yay
(flutteryay)
fail?!?
why?
(facehoof)
flutterfail is not a real emo
(twicrazy)
emo.hazasite.com
Now powered by moovweb!
(badpokerface)
/me is all alone in the platform room
/me is dancing in his underwear in the platform room
/me is karate chopping monitors in the platform room
I think there's a github issue for that
removing the flag from the recipe should fix it
but we have to find out why we added the flag in there in the first place =x
yeah
Yeah, no one knows why we even have that flag there =x
so we have to find out whether we actually for for it or not before we remove it.
Lemme look into that now :p
wait what
it's heroku
oh
I see
hampton changed my account
sorry, emo is not heroku, it's moovweb
hampton changed my account name, so now it can't find the slug :p
fixing :p
just need to push again
ok
I can't fix this
nevermind
I fail
at life
You should be disappoint in hampton : p
yeah, but the git server needs to change too
@NaseemMakiya @MichaelCatlin http: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes
@all emo is back!  http: //emo.hazasite.com/
I'll jump on the blame bandwagon
You check email in the shower, that's pretty hard core.
I might come in later today
if I feel better
maybe after lunch
oh don't worry
lol, ok fine :p
I have to meet someone in the financial district from lunch..
heh
Guess I'll just go there and come back home then :p
sriracha will kill anything...and everything
Hmmm
if someone/thing is being a bastard to someone, does that mean that the someone is the single parent?
This video is making me scared of dick
And by dick, i'm assuming she was referring to richard
Richard will make you slap somebody, hell, maybe even pull a gun on somebody!
ok, i'm done.
really?
that sucks
Never realized that that's what it did
hrrmrmrmrm
I don't like that it alters the state of the issue
I like the fact that it links the commit to the issue if you just mention #issuenum, but actually changing the state of the issue should be a manual process
that's lame
yeah
github, why u so eager to close things >.<
that's not that bad
yeah, but several outings
fancy fridays was in the same par, and was only one night (ajlie)
I'm never opening a tab on my name again (noooo)
We went to a bar, and Tarun convinced me that opening a tab on my name and getting it reimbursed by the company was a good idea :p
question
to everything
should the default option for moov login be to edit your ssh/config file or to not edit your ssh/config file?
I'm leaning towards pro-edit.
But I'm also weary of changing people's conf files by default.
@hcatlin opinion?
this usually is not a problem, as ssh will try all the keys until it finds one that works
however, since we have an open ssh connection to everything with an account, if you have two ssh keys for two different accounts, you won't be able to push to one of them.
The file is the same in all OSes
I already wrote the parsing of it, it would have to be thoroughly tested though.
Yeah, this is a separate issue between the account flipping we talked earlier.
Before we talked about moving the same key from one account to another on moov login
Hmm, I guess this scenario would only apply if we didn't have the previous feature
Hmmmm
ok, yeah, nevermind, this is no longer relevant
forget I said anything
I'm le sick, i don't know what I'm talking about
verbed?
(sadtroll)
I'm assuming it was Chris :p
yes
no
maybe
:p
wow

Nah, the real Hampton is hipchat's chrome support
:p

Was it phallic?
haha
Hey @JajaB I have a pull request for you to review since it involves logging changes
Field trip to Hampton lake?
but has the *company* been there?
I hate all you sicklings
Stepping out for lunch...
nice
lol
oh mat, wasting your votes away on things that don't matter
sure they do (truestory)
oh, nice
but until then, you don't get to vote?
that's terrible
so if you vote for a bunch of things that'll never get done, you're screwed
I only use the webapp :p
ahhh
that's weird, so I can take my votes back?
wow
so troll
ha
@JajaB let me know when you've taken a look at the two pull requests, I'd like to merge one  of them in to the master branch as well.
yeah
well
I hope
that's the plan
wait till then?
that's fine by me.
k, sounds good
a push of a button by Sean or Hampton :p
(pronounced shompton"
ha
sean
such a silly name
who the hell looks at "sean" and pronounces it "shon"?
oh man, sean2
I did that in middle school to
but on purpose, to tease kids named sean : p
what the what
fancy
yeah
that is better
shawn, shaun, shon, those are all fine
no, those are weird
@hcatlin shouldn't tritium-tester use simple-mobile by default?
or if not, at least it should specify which mixer to use in the UI, no?
nevermind, looks like that's what we're doing.
nope
looks like a syntax error in your tritium
maybe the compiling was off by one or something
or rather, the refreshing
of the code
er
tritium
Man
I installed go in my windows machine
and it told me to restart
so I did
it's been 20 minutes
it's stuck in the shutdown screen
telling me to wait
cause it's configuring stuff
and to "please do not turn off your computer..."
screw you windows
freaking shut down
I'm not, that would brick it
but seriously
that's ridiculous
ok
noj is gonna make soup while windows boots up
miso!

proxy doesn't use any database related things
so unless someone has their own personal experience with go and databases
I would say we don't
Actually, I got that from the social room :p
@SeanJ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMMlzQsQPk4
macys is kind of funny, make sure they clear their cookies
if they visited the normal macys site before
that might cause some issues
or the production macys site (m.macys.com)(
As far as I can tell, they should work fine in nosaka, @ZhigangChen2 knows more about cookies and how they work though
nope, and that's not good
can you describe the conditions which yielded that?
interesting
same error, but hard crash this time?
oh, what was the different error?

I have a question
can I get a drawer/filing cabinet >.>
1) the candy for the android jar, I need to keep it under lock and key, it seems I can't trust the people in this office anymore.
2) Napkins and utensils, right now they're all over my desk, and it makes me a sad panda.
3) Paper, so I don't have to run to the printer every time I need paper
4) Pens, so that they're not all over my desk, making me sad
5) drugs
6) business cards, so they're not all over my desk making me sad
:p
YES!
I assume the perpretrator will not have enough motivation to lock pick it :p
Soooooooooooooo, can I get one?!?!
Also, clearing my desk from all the work-related stuff will free up my deskspace for fun things!
Like juggling balls, and toys and stuff ^.^
mustache stickers!
Juan helps me a lot :p
:p
soooo, I can haz cabinet??!?!?
plip
@AaronLeung I got a core dump when compiling sass:
er, path
@ZhigangChen2 0adc8d749891ae53cc9ca4e513d627862cfa1d04
is it the github one michael linked?
@hcatlin about the better error messages, please file a github issue with the specific problem which causes non-friendly error messages.  Thanks!
I'm working on jdparts >.>
you know more specifics <.<
yup
do a pull
it's working now
@SeanJ about the pumpkin stuff
Deb convinced me to do it anyways, just spinning it as pumpkin decoration contest rather than carving
But we talked about it and thought doing it on Wednesday would be better
Figured we could order lunch on Wednesday and have people work on it during lunch, we also wanted to do teams based on departments
so like
platform vs mobile dev vs support vs account managers vs financial&admin&marketing, etc...
sound reasonable?
Yeah, there's a lot of people that are in two or three departments
I would leave it free-flowy
but bucketing people in A team is better than telling them to form their own teams
then if they're unhappy about it, they can switch
Teams are based on the people they hang out with most of the time anyways
so that would be nice.
Ok, so I'll send an email about it.  Wednesday is good then?
@SeanJ regarding the connections fix for mps
The fix is in, is the deployment/testing of it higher priority than jdparts?
We can deploy it to the test cluster today, and at least do those steps
test cluster deployment is automated through nooppy
ok
Yep, I doubt Josh would give us that much power :p
yeah, np
Yup
Adding an extra pixel to the image that is overlapping should fix it
(aka, the one that is peeking through"
You mean turn the server on/off without killing/restarting it?
so pause would be like perfect proxy?
@hcatlin I fixed the sprites problem
gonna push the change now
some of our sprite sizes were not divisible by 2
I went through all of them and changed their size to be divisible by 2
and now they're all showing up nicely, without overlaps
you should le pull

I've infiltrated the office.
to my surprise, mague beat me to it.
I walked, so if by traffic, you mean crowds of people I had to ninja my way through, then yes.
Looks like the start of the parade is on Spear street too, that's where all the cable cars, cars, and floats are stationed right now.
I dunno
it's super quiet here
once you get to the office, it's totally fine
She's not
she doesn't have a moovweb email yet?
that's very crippling
@SeanJ no, this is only on the moov server command
moov production and mps don't check for open ports
@hcatlin can explain it better, but basically, the idea is that we don't care about waiting 2 minutes for an upstream call, but waiting over 30 seconds for transformations is killer.
Some customers might pay us enough money that we could increase the processing timeout, but their servers might be super slow, so they might not see the effect.
For now it would be global timeout
but eventually we'd like to migrate it to a per-project-basis
Whether that's through giedi or the slug, we have yet to decide.
@ZhigangChen2 are you suggesting we change the logic of max-request-timeout to only look at processing time?
I would rather leave things the way they are for now
Hmm
seems reasonable
also, @SeanJ about moov login
You're right in the behavior that you described
perhaps we should call it git_ready or something
yes
no
the feature is fully integrated, it doesn't need any apollo changes
this is all about managing the state in the sdk side
before, the SDK had no idea whether we uploaded keys or not
apollo knows if we uploaded *a* key, but not from which box
sure, I'll rename to the ssh_key_uploaded
@SeanJ actually, the flag is currently called ".push-ready"
:p
semantics issue...guess It doesn't matter much
you can push to moov cloud
the idea is the following:  push ready encompasses what we'd like to accomplish --> to push to moov cloud, if the flag is there, we should be able to push to moov cloud
ssh-key-uploaded encompasses an action that took place
it says that a key was uploaded
right now that's the same as saying we're push ready
but it might not be in the future.
that's the same thing....
no, push ready is vague in the sense of what took place, but it's descriptive in the sense of what you can do if the flag is there.
ssh-key-uploaded is the opposite.
Right, right now it doesn't.
whatever, I changed it to ssh-key-uploaded
sigh
I fixed one github issue, refresh my github issues page, and the counter increased instead of decreased
yeah, no worries, it was just a moment of demotivation :p
k
yeah, we have a lot
@SeanJ it would be a pretty big pain, we would have to apply it to every go installation in all the slave machines, and if any of them went down, we'd have to reapply it in the new go installation.
But the SSL error that it fixed was for a single demo customer
How is this relevant to host_maps
Are you saying we should disallow upstreams that have a path?
Ok.  Let's close that issue and just add this as a comment to the hostname validator issue.
The actual issue has no actionable items, right?
@JoseEspinosa I posted a message on that thread
@TarunDesikan do you know how to make nginx read config files from a custom location?
Hmmm, doesn't seem to be working...
ok, figured it out
it's a combination of both -p and -c
I'm just using the one installed in nosandbox
Maybe we should have a ticket for ops to update the nginx for production
Up to you ;)
make sure libiconv is before libxml
everything else doesn't matter
is this windows?
oh, you should ask aaron, he recently tried to get the build environment to work in windows
It's just the default rails template =(
Z made some major changes to the asset server
what exactly is the issue you're seeing?
@MichaelCatlin go test -v ./test/omni-mobile
Hmm
@ZhigangChen2 for (( i=0;i<$2;i++ ))\ndo\n	if [ "$1" == "normal" ]; then\n		normal_call\n	elif [ "$1" == "timeout" ]; then\n		timeout_call\n	fi\ndone
Hmm, yeah, I've seen maybe 10ish or so today...
oh
they're all from cluster 2 (test cluster)
me and Z were testing some stuff there
should be fine

where are you?
I'm doing that right now actually
result is in json, which is hard to parse in bash, so making a python script to deal with it.
hmm
is there any filtering that we can do in the request?
like, in the request to get all simple mobile mixers, can I also request that I only want the publicly released ones?
Hmm
ok, that should be good enough for now
thanks!
np
that was weird
he had a super old version of manhattan gem
3.3, he must be an avid user :p
yeah, that's bazaar
hai, sou desu ka
is the fix in deploy branch?
was it tested?
okie dokie, deploying
@JoseEspinosa It's deployed, please test
will have to check
I just assume installshield premier lets me do whatever I want...including puppies, rainbows, and unicorns
honestly, it might be easier to do that :p

yes, pushing allowed

I've been meaning to play with it too, but I'm not musically talented
known issue, we're working on it right now
looks like its working now
nvm
ugh
Hmm
ask them to run ssh-keygen
then call moov login after that, and upload the keygen they generated from ssh-keygen
Hmm
I see
lemme see if I can take over..
Hmmmm, looks like windows thinks his home directory is c:\windows instead of...what it's supposed to be...
@hcatlin you around?
oh, nvm
I asked other people....it was about opinions regarding setting the HOME varialbe in the windows installer
@JoseEspinosa Master is broken, looks like it's a butler compile time error.
assets/images?
it was all like, nuh uh?
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
I wonder...
*digs in buildbox code*
Nope, we should be uploading them to our assets
you can't?
hmm
I think the ports thing is fixed
Or i think Z fixed it
you should ask him for confirmation.
oh @ZhigangChen2 ! Mat has a question for you =D
cool!
oh man, the blue thing still throws me off a bit
but everything else is amazing
oh...the search bar is kinda weak =/
yeah, still don't like it :p
Where does it say that?
btw, search bar doesn't even work
=(
I am using chrome =(
box is colored so that I can't read what I type, and pressing enter doesn't search =(
oh, there it goes
I was typing random stuff too quickly, so it didn't come up with anything
the search box should be raised a bit too, it's off center from the rest of the stuff in that row
And the font is serif?  that's different from all the things!
Good, if Mat was our only client, we'd be set :p
Let's get dkleined in here, he'll rape it pixel by pixel :p
that fixes?
lemme try
omg, so much better
btw
search bar looks like crap on everything except mac :p
(tested on windows chrome)
tested windows (chrome, firefox, IE), and linux (chrome, firefox), all have a crappy search bar
Hari is looking into it, he has an idea why
Sounds good
@MichaelCatlin I can't replicate paul's issue =(
http://mstage.warehouse.co.uk works fine =/
It's hard to say
It's weird that he can access it
cause he can see the connection being dropped error message
which means he reached us, and the connection being dropped is an error between us and warehouse.co.uk
But that doesn't change between me and him
so I don't understand why it would work when I hit it in here, vs him hitting it.
guys
api.go makes me cry

all time!
true that
or not if him and MC were rivals
hey guy
I am not authorized to access that page
if you change the hostvar, you have to build again before the change takes effect
woot, I can see it now
Yeah, for now you do
I think we're working on a way to force a no-op build
yup yup
Guys, I'm scared of bro-friday...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zvTRQr7ns8
@NaseemMakiya maybe they're spelling mobile wrong?  If it's misspelled, it woudl default to "base"
I think
actually, let me check that
nevermind
it tells you it's wrong
if its mispelled
that's not gonna work
he's gonna have to change his hostmap
wow, I just realized that when I mentioned Naseem, that message probably popped up on his laptop >.<
how?
looking at the logs
only one of your builds failed (because the hostnames you were using were already taken)
the other builds succeeded.  Check apollo
@JoseEspinosa
what do you mean?
what was the question?
Hmmm
brew uninstall doesn't work?
Hmmm, not sure
perhaps they can just run brew upgrade moovweb?
can you give that a try and see if it works?
@SeanJ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PsnxDQvQpw
@AaronLeung http://mmdayaram3067.cuteoverload.com.moovapp.com/  This project is importing body.ts and it's running in moovcloud A-OK!
Yeah
It was an upstream problem
well
kind off
of*
why?
what happened was that the form they were trying to submit
had a hidden CSRF token
but the form was malformed html
(as in, the input was outside the <form> element)
because of this
when it went through our parser
the input was not included in the form
and so if you submitted, you would send the form without that input, and that's when the upstream would go "blargh"
so they basically just have to fix their forms in the upstream side, was all.
But that was a very specific issue
Instead of going "dropped upstream connection, EOF", their server should've returned an error message
so they're handling it particularly incorrectly.
right
Z pointed out, that if they were trying to do a perfect proxy, then the form was fine
I believe the problem was that they were moving the form to a specific location using tritium
but the input CSRF element was outside the form, so it didn't get moved along with it.
that's how they got disconnected.
and then they must've probably removed it using tritium as well unintentionally.
@MichaelCatlin any word regarding that git isseu?
hmm
okie dokes
@ZhigangChen2 http://play.golang.org/
@JoseEspinosa Hampton said "sleep and fluids" to answer your question
build box already has 4.1.224
As far as the api call, I'm going to need the parameters necessary to make the call, and where to get the information.
Sure.  I'll test it out and then deploy it, just send me over the info regarding what api call I need to make to apollo
@JoseEspinosa let me know when the changes are in apollo master branch so that I can check locally.
What I do:  I added the build directory to my PATH, and now can run those scripts from anywhere
Examples:  If I want to compile a target but don't want to pull/clone all its dependencies, I use "gb"
gb manhattan/targets/powermoov
If I want to run a compiled target, I use "run" -->  This will set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, or PATH depending on your OS
ldrun is good for running go tests (at least that's what I use it for mostly)
go test ./tritium/test will throw and error if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set
so I just use "ldrun go test ./tritium/test"
Let me know if you guys find it useful.
ha, ok
that's right
I checked out the js-redirection branch in apollo right now
and have been testing the flow
it looks like for some projects, it works ok
but for others, I get a 422
on the host_map_registration call
not sure why exactly, no error messages are spat out.
for example
mdayaram/dashy <-- works fine
noj/hipchatemo <--- 422 error
I traced it to line 151
in app/models/project.rb
that's what's causing the error
I can show you what the two hostmaps look like
This is mdayaram/dashy
[{"Direction":"=\u003e","Cookie_Domain":".cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Value":"http: //cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Protocol":"http","Upstream_Host":"cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Port":80,"Proxy_Value":"http: //noj.cuteoverload.com","Proxy_Protocol":"http","Proxy_Host":"noj.cuteoverload.com","Proxy_Port":80},{"Direction":"=\u003e","Cookie_Domain":".cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Value":"https: //cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Protocol":"https","Upstream_Host":"cuteoverload.com","Upstream_Port":80,"Proxy_Value":"https: //noj.cuteoverload.com","Proxy_Protocol":"https","Proxy_Host":"noj.cuteoverload.com","Proxy_Port":80}]
bastards
hipchat shrank it
the only difference I can tell is that one has one host rule, while the other has two host rules
(the one with two host rules fails)
sure
using js_redirection branch in apollo
sending you the config.json files right now.
Hmmmm, that didn't used to be a problem.  That project is live right now, so the hostnames can't be duplicated
what part of the code throws the error? Is it something that depends on it starting with the hostvar?  Cause that won't always be the case.
They're in
Right now we're ignoring errors
when we release 4.1.225, I'll turn error checking on
Also, when we release apollo :p
If there's any errors when uploading the hostmap or when trying to read host_map.moov, we ignore them right now
since, host_map.moov doesn't get created yet, and apollo isn't set up to receive the call yet.
Once those two pieces are in place, I'll turn error checking on, so if your project doesn't create a host_map.moov, we'll stop the build, and if apollo responds with an error, we'll stop the build.
@SeanJ I need user/pass info for rentacenter
@ZhigangChen2 172.16.0.191
mlocal.cuteoverload.com
@SeanJ http://sanfranliving.tumblr.com/post/33903719765/if-someone-brings-la-boulange-breakfast-for-the-whole
I'm sure we can recreate it next time you bring some caneles :p
true
Yeah, I had to mess with it a bit cause it didn't let me add the 4.2 filter normally
Had to browse to all issues in MoovSDK and then click on issues from 4.2, then click on issues assigned to me only :p
I think it's because not all kinds of issues have the field "Fix Version"
i don't think that it's the value thing, but rather, some types of issues don't have the field "fix version" in general, so like, issues under Ops, 1800flowers, etc... they don't have a "Fix Version" field in their templates, so when I go to My Open Issues and try to add a filter for Fix Version, it tells me that it's invalid in this scope
weird
Yeah, it tells "Fix Version is not applicable for the current project and/or issue type"
project being the MoovSDK
but if I just browse the MoovSDK page
and click through there
it's fine
anywho
look at the satisfying yet pointless arguments we're having about music release dates, almost as satisfying as music labels :p
woops, wrong window
my social chats have spread to other rooms :p
@all I'm going to call it a day, get some more rest.
later
feel free to call if something happens
yeah, could be a few things.  I'm still in commute, is someone else around to help?
ask him to run ssh-add <path to key>	in git bash
where his key got generated.  if he doesn't know, then it's probably the default, in which case, you can just run ssh-add without any arguments
ugh, I spent a good while trying to figure that one out and got no where =(
I know it's some kind of conflict between the git that comes installed with cygwin and the git that we install, but that's all I got.
tried installing cygwin to replicate, but couldn't =(
@MichaelCatlin it looks like he probably tried running "git bash" in the command line
^.^) :: /home/noj $ git bash\ngit: 'bash' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.\n\nDid you mean this?\n	stash\n
Yeah...
yes, sorry, was working with jaja on something
yeah, identity added is good
ask him to try pushing again
no, that shouldn't be necessary
@hcatlin I'd be fine with that
not today though :p
it worked?!?!?!
omg, so happy!
I love it when the first thing I suggest works ^.^
so if you generate a new key, and ssh-agent is already running, it won't recognize the key until it's added to its cache
ssh-add adds it to the agent's cache
the ssh-agent is the thing that does the authentication when you do ssh operations, including git ones.
one way to fix it is to restart the agent, but that's pretty intense, ssh-add just tells the agent there's a new key
I'll make sure we do that automatically starting 4.2
that would be super useful
though I hope that when she uninstalls cygwin, that it doesn't leave any remnants of itself that might skew things off.
oh
dam
I remember this
ugh
Hmm
let me spend some time looking it up a bit
ok
so a "bad file number" error in windows
means that the port is blocked
probably an antivirus or windows firewall
on port 22
@MichaelCatlin
yup, glad that uninstall cygwin fixed it.
though that's still unconcerning...
bloop
sigh, everyone is gone
hello!
I'm feeling much better...woke up like an hour ago.
I took all the drugs possible.
didn't sleep too well last night, nose was too stuffy, didn't take enough drugs.
oh, nice
did you order whiskey sour with bourbon?
did you look badass?
is there gonna be a second date?
hahahhaa
I saw that same sign somewhere
where did you take that picture?
oh
in that case
that sign exists somewhere in san francisco!
go find it!
@MichaelCatlin did you get your question answered?
ok, cool
@SeanJ do you still have your github to jira script?
I was thinking that it might be a good idea to transfer over all the closed github issues to jira (closed jira issues that is).  It would help in terms of searching for old issues.  We wouldn't have to search JIRA and then github if we suspect we tackled something already.
@all http://www.quickmeme.com/Ridiculously-photogenic-guy/
other option is to stick with apollo
actually, that might be more complicated
As long as our mascot is this guy:  http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091021193516/phineasandferb/images/7/7e/Perry_the_platypus.png
then I don't care what we're called.
also
I hated the name plop from the beginning
fyi
But I do like the platypus being a our mascot
if we're playing this game: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=manoj
I am
I am so good, people can't even understand my skills
That is indeed one of my many skills
to panic kernels
yep, one sec
it's syslog
seriously
I feel like I spent all day today just looking through JIRA emails
(raritywhine)
(noooo)
@SeanJ @hcatlin you guys are mean, please answer my phone calls :p
Being remote is so sad.
(sadtroll)
excellent
did you ask about the platypus mascot?
lame
@AaronLeung it looks like the mixer tests are still failing, is this expected? (by the way, the mixer tests only run against the master branch)
Could you guys take a look at them?  I fixed a compile time issue with the mixer tests, but the tests themselves are still failing.
If it seems like an issue Z caused, just bump it to him
thanks
versioning control system
Hmm
I would sub "system" for "service"
since git is a versioning control system
but github is more of a service
Hmmm, but we do kind of host projects : p
checking
Works like a charm
thanks
Yeah, that would be good
yup, ok
k
I've tested normal http and that seems to work fine
testing ssl now
Hmm
x-forwarded-for doesn't seem to be appended on https requests...did the nginx ssl config get updated in cl02?
No, that's not right.
or is it?
hmll
hmm
no, it's fine, I missed a spot in the configs, fixing it now'
k
@JajaB Hmm, still not working
hrmrmrmrmr...let me see if I missed any other spots...
@AaronLeung @ZhigangChen2 did you guys take a look at the mixer tests and tritium-tester repos and why they're failing?
I guess people are out for lunch
which reminds me, I should have lunch
ya, saw the email
I figured we would use confluence for that
instead of making our own
That seems to be the case for tritium-tester
but the simple-mobile failure is test failures
seems to be regarding the path changes
right
thanks
@all I fixed the issues with tritium tester.
But I would like to point out that the issues are from at least three different people.
Please check jenkins after you make any commits to see if something is broken, honestly, it's not that hard to figure out if something that broke is from your changes.
go home
and party it up at home like I am!
heh
the hell?
oh man, I'm gonna hang my stockings on it!
@AaronLeung you broke tritium 4.1 =(
PITA?
I thought we decided we wouldn't backport it but just hack it?
True...
sweet
@AaronLeung looks good
so this contains the fix so that read(..) and @import .. don't check outside the scope, right?
k, let me build a manhattan and then we can test with the created gem/package
Hmm, that is less important than this one
the build is gonna take a while, so I'll test it later today
have to test the apollo deploy now anyways
yeah
do
inside ambrosia
sorry
inside ambrosia/test
run
go test --mixer=simple-mobile --test-data=../transform
@AaronLeung the changes you made for the backport, were those only in the tritium repo?
k
what is it?
that's weird...jenkins doesn't seem to get that anymore
I don't get that either
did you pull the ambrosia repo? (it doesn't get pulled with the build sccripts
)
cool
Hmm, I'm seeing that too
looks like it
it's the flush_client script
supposed to flush cdn cache
but I don't know what exactly it's doing, it's an ops scripts, need to pull in ops for this.
don't have the source for it.
It's calling /usr/bin/flush_client --build $1 in the build box
Is jaja in the office?  he doesn't seem to be responding?
Well, looks like this affects all pushes
so pushes are out of commission until this is resolved...
this should've been caught by our current monit check
I asked in ops room, no one is responding.
thanks
@all we need to have a status page for our customers now that we have lots of moving parts.
Something like this:  http://status.edgecast.com/
Would a tailored one for each customer be beneficial, or is generic enough?
in terms of generic, what do we have?
True
like the home page in noopy
plus a few things like pushing
In fact, why *aren't* we using the home page of nooppy as our current status page.
That's perfect.
Just missing the pushing bit :p
Right right, what I'm saying though is that the status checking has already been built, should be super quick to push it to a simple front end site and put it behind status.moovweb.com
anywho, does't matter, as long as it's in the roadmap, I'm happy
tell them do run this on the terminal
curl -D /dev/stdout -o /dev/null m.mysite.com
It will output a few things, one of them will be
X-S-V: myacount/myproject <githash>
oh, you mean version of sdk
yeah
that too
oh, we could've just told him that, :p
that's the same for everyone
should be
yup, it is
is his problem libsass or something?
@Ishan moovops?
moovstatus?  what would be a good name, we should nab it as soon as possible
lol
twitter handle hoard
@SeanJ the build box is running moov version 4.1.225, can we prerelease that one in apollo?
@MichaelCatlin the build box is building the project using 4.1.225 to build the project, Sean is in the process of pre-releasing it so Paul can download it once that's done.
@SeanJ was 4.1.225 prereleased?
k
cool, thanks
It is
automatically creating a git tag for their repo
whenever they push to moov cloud
I'm still somewhat meh about the idea
but the big peeps want it.
It's basically a human-readable name for a githash
It would't happen every commit, but the big peeps want it to happen on every push to moovcloud
ugh, the more I think about the feature, the less I like it
oh well...
Yeah, but unless they do a pull from moov cloud, they won't get to see the build number at all
juicer?, you mean the nutribullet?
nice
momma sent that to me
told me to drink more blended juices
Oh moms
My mom doesn't have a cell phone :p
Also, I'm telling your wife you asked for my moms phone number :p
ha
heh
where did I come into play with this?
I'm the victim here
Nice
did you go to foreign cinema?
@MatB I'm also the loser cause I'm home sick instead of in the office with my juicer
Glad you liked the place
nice
fourth date this weekend?
hahaha
@MatB keeping everyone in line
make sure you bring your military drill sergeant hat when you come by =D
(rdsalute)
As per Seans suggestion, i got a bunch of blueberries from instacart to munch on
Unfortunately, they seem to be frozen blueberries
Now I'm chomping on frozen blueberries, not as delicious, but I hope for similar results.
I CAN'T! My blender is at work ='(
Hmm, I have a hammer, that's the closest to a meat tenderizer :p
@MichaelCatlin @NaseemMakiya Peeps in the support chat
ah
yeah, no worries, I would help them out, but a little busy at the moment
no
only assets and slug
do you want to add one?  Shouldn't be too hard, requires changes in apollo and BB
lol
ask me a question, and then run to post pictures in the social room before I get a chance to answer :p
:p
If you want a max git repo size
create a JIRA issue
probably under Build box
and I'll get to it
also specify what you want the size to be :p
make sure you give it the 4.2 fix version
(or 4.3 if you want to wait for that)
ah
checking now
hmmm
well, not sure if this is the issue
but first thing that strikes me as odd
she's trying to generate the project inside the System32 folder
which is a bad idea in general
Yeah, definitely cd somewhere else
that's the other thing
the authenticity thing is not a big deal, that happens the first time you try to ssh to our server
but
the weird thing is
it tried to write to /h/.ssh/known_host
which means her home directory is fudged
ssh thinks her home directory is in /h/
So I would say
tell her to set her HOME directory
to C:\Users\HERUSERNAME
in the Environment Variables settings for control panel, there's a link somewhere, lemme fetch it.
http://www.itechtalk.com/thread3595.html
I think we have an issue in zendesk about this too
lemme check
hmm, can't find
But yeah, those are the two things that jump at me
do you want me to reply, or you gots it?
alrighty, cool
np, I hope this solves their issue, this is almost a month or two old
@all I'm upgrading the build box to 4.1.226 to include @AaronLeung 's changes that fix the security issue with read(...) and @import ...
@SeanJ can you prerelease 4.1.226, it's the same as 225 except it has Aaron's security fixes for read(..) and @import ..
thanks
d'awww
he looks so fuzzy
"ohai!"
http://i.qkme.me/3ski0f.jpg
>.>  It's our unfortunate legacy environment variable that can be used to override where we read mixers and other information from.
changing it is rather cumbersome now, since I haven't a clue how many ops things might use it.
But if you would like a better name, we could introduce a new one...
Something like, MOOV_DATA or something
http://i.qkme.me/3ski18.jpg
They're usually auto-downloaded for you.
Hmmm, I don't believe we have a public facing page where you can download them.  I can give you a link, but a user would not be able to find it themselves.
what you could do
does intramoov have the server command?
It does look that way
Ok, calm down :p
oh, yeah, that's where moov server usually downloads them to
I will sit here and pretend I'm part of the meeting.
deedle deedle doot, dooby doo
just ate a whole bunch of gummy vitamins
I'll be tip top shape in the morn!
If we integrate with github
I think it makes sense to push a tag to github
but tagging our repo doesn't make sense
We could have an option
erm, nevermind
we don't need an api
not our build key, but *a* key
what does that have to do with github?
oh
no
I don't think we should pull code from github
yea
code, yes, tags, not so much
Basically, the idea is that you use github (or any other git hosting service, we don't care) for your version control
You give us a git URI
and during build, we push tags to that URI
doesn't matter if its github or whatever
that is true, that is the one thing
but
if we support our git repo tagging, then we're basically adding a bandaid when we know we need surgery :p
Then we have to support the stop gap even if we do introduce the actual feature...
I would understand the stopgap if no workaround was found
but the workaround is pretty easy
what do you mean?
if we do the github feature, why would we bother tagging our own repos?
That's completely different
tagging locally on the build box does not add the tags to the git server
adding tags to the get server is more involved
we can't just do it on the build box, because if we push, we trigger a build
k
TL;DR:  Manoj is being bitchy again about stupid things :p
cool
@all can someone push something to moov cloud to make sure I'm not crazy?
works?
@SeanJ did it finish?
howdy
yar
truth
(flutteryay)
oh
Hm
I guess so
Um
I think this is a question better asked to ops
but I think it's better for them to use the domain instead of an actual ip
cause we might change things in the future.
oh, prolly ask tomorrow, i hear they're fighting lots of fires today
Oh, @hcatlin can probably answer that question too though
I think what they really want
is have one rule
that will allow all talks with us
so not just one IP
but an IP range
like
123.123.123.123/8  <== this will cover all moov servers, no worries
ok, well, I think that's what they want, or rather, something like that :p
(from the sounds of it)
I guess best answer for now is to tell them No, use the domain name, and then we can figure out if we want to support an IP range whitelist later
The two that are required for sure
are
git.moovweb.com on port 22 (might be blocked)
those are the only ones
that the SDK needs
blargh
I forgot my work laptop at work
fml
(raritywhine)
It's ok, still have lots to do without it.
howdy
nooooooooooo
(noooo)
did they try
?
ok
Sounds good
also ask them to run
and to put the output on the ticket
Desired output should be a message telling them "Hi { user }! You've successfully authenticated, but Moovweb doesn't provide shell access."
If they get a timeout error, or a bad file number error, it probably means that it's a firewall issue
if they get a "Permission denied (public key)" error, then it means the SSH keys are not setup correctly, or locally their ssh is not using the correct key.
@TarunDesikan @MichaelCatlin Please chat here about our internal issues :p
got the email
but clicking the link redirects me to the error I get
For brew and linux, it's a good idea
for windows, we have an issue to add an exception to windows firewall by the installer
though I'm not sure how likely that will be.
beta?
Hmm, not sure, I still get the error, but if it's a DNS entry, it could take up to a few hours to refresh
ah, so it was a URL setting in zendesk, got it.
doesn't work for me =(
still doesn't work
:p
oh my
ok
@MichaelCatlin ask boris to generate a project with a *new* name
Either that, or ask him to git clone the older project.
I'm locked out =(
git cloning is an issue that is currently on helpdesk that I wanted to provide input for but I can't cause I can't access helpdesk :p
I still can't :p
lol
I don't think it was horribilia
because I've accessed help desk relatively recently, definitely monday I believe.
@MichaelCatlin k
@MichaelCatlin It's the same problem we had before, he must've created his account after horribilia, which means he's not the owner of his account
yup, should be the same fix.
@MatB as a side note, can we add a migration in the next apollo deploy that finds all people that aren't owners of their own account and makes them so?
Yeah, if someone signs up now they should be good
@TarunDesikan only happens to people who signed up between Friday and Monday
of last week
(fix was out monday, right?)
Oh, no, this is a completely different issue from zendesk
True, but that should be the end of that one :p
yeah
hmm, let's talk in support as to not confuse these guys :p
Also, it seems that Boris could access zendesk, so normal users are fine.
Oooh
that looks like all the people with problems except sean
g'night
I tried, but my shrink told me to stop coming :p
Ha
Ok, I'm spent :p
yar, g'night sir
hmmm, lemme try
what version of moov @MichaelCatlin ?
Yeah, I only got one domain too
@MichaelCatlin wikipedia.org still works, as in, it gets all the subdomains
@MatB SDK::SiteAnalyzer couldn't determine page encoding for craigslist.org: Sorry, we can't guess the encoding on a nil object
Should I open a JIRA issue?
ah, excellent :p
I'll make one.
doen
done*
no worries
there's a bug in apollo
I submitted an issue
mat's gonna look at it
also
@MichaelCatlin we have a workaround for the ssh problem
Juan ran SSH on port 22 and 443, took him like two seconds
moov generate still hardcodes to use 22, so that won't work
but you can tell them to git clone using this (and it should work)
yar
I still don't have access
we should have both
halp.moovweb.com
just CNAME to help.moovweb.com
back
sorry
what's up?
omg, i want to kill myself.
let's do moov server first
you need to create a formula...it's a little involved, is this for a customer?
If you give me the tar.gz file, I can create a link with it that they can just "brew install <link>"
ah
lemme set that up for ya.
@MichaelCatlin brew install https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/moovweb.rb
yup
@JajaB http://noj.cc/p/everybodyhurts
@MichaelCatlin @NaseemMakiya the port 22 fix has been pre-released in apollo
yupyup
It should be live in prod right now
so check logstash mps logs
mps logs with @severity = request
those logs should contain a field calls "xff"
you need to check three things:
1) x-forwarding-for is set correctly in the normal case
2) if x-forwarded-for is already set, then we append to it rather than obliterate it
3) the above two also work for https
You can spoof the x-forwarded-for with curls
It's a log frontend where all our logs end up, kibana is another one
I'm slightly amused, and slightly annoyed
True, but I still don't see why that would be a cause to block us
@MichaelCatlin that's in the varnish cache.vcl file, under the config directory
the PPP=20
sorry, I'm referring to the support room issue
well
bloomingdales doesn't seem to have it
but macys does (just checked sorry)
macy's is editing a cookie in the varnish cache
the cookie controls the number of items to display per page
the cache.vcl forces the value of the cookie to be 20, regardless of what macys actually responds with
but bloomingdales doesn't have this, so it should be fine...
yeah, but...we rather them not do it...since that feature won't be available in nosaka...at least not through varnish cache
so they want to do the same thing as in macys?  just hardcode products per page to be 20?
Hmm, that seems to be a git error related to several users in the same computer trying to use the same git repository
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367258/using-git-without-sudo-in-many-accounts
also, sorry about the support thing, I think I just confused myself, might be simpler than I'm thinking, let me know if you need help with it though
@all I feel really dumb asking this, but for the life of me I can't remember and I can't seem to find it, but is there an easy way to delete an element from an array/slice in go? Or do I have to do the shifting in the array myself?
sigh, it's like no one's in chat (rdcry)
too late
nearly 50 minutes too late
like everybody else (raritywhine)
thats fair, real people > electronic people
(ppshrug)
you think this is human like?

indeed
I...don't know anything about that place?
sounds like it's further way from market street
ooooh
BUT THEY RAN OUT OF MILK!
those bastards!
well who's laughing now toaster!
oh
ok
well
still
MILK!
with MILK!
I'm already a member of the YMCA....
video? can someone share?
we were already like a block away from it :p
:p
can someone share the hampton vid?
when are we scheduled to move?
plus, not to mention, change all my addresses
oh my, and all our business cards need to be reprinted!
=(
@all does anyone know how to import inside functions/main.ts?
I tried just having another file inside the functions directory and doing an @import stuff.ts inside main.ts, but that didn't seem to work =(
It's not working for me ='(
that is completely irrelevant to my issue, but if you're just giving them out, I'll take one
but I do have a VM for windows 8, so it's not necessary
yeah, it's not necessary, but always nicer to work with an actual laptop than a VM
oh yeah, definitely, I love the blame, give it to me.
yup, I'm a ridiculously demanding employee :p
Please dump it on my desk so that I may play with it!
woooooooooooooooooo
that's nice, my VM was acting funky anyways, it didn't have a charm bar
look at me, using win8 lingo, charm bar, I'm so pro
yeah, that didn't do anything in my VM
charms bar be broked
OOOoooOooo!
wait
ew
windows phone dev......I guess....that might be useful...
this is going to bring up a whole lot of IE pain, isn't it?
windows phone uses IE, no/
?
oh, no, I mean for people developing websites
right now they've only worried about webkit browsers
if we want to target win phones, they're gonna have to worry about IE
ew, I don't want to read that.
I wish they'd just adapt IE 10 to be more like webkit -.-
indeed
yay
so many laptops
under my desk
I could make a song about them
vista, 7, and now 8
hey
is anyone in the platform room still?
is Jose there? :p
no, you nor doug count :p
@TarunDesikan you still there?
oh, I was going to ask you about the email I just sent out
does help.moovweb.com work for you now?
@lv no way, really?
woots!
Hmm, what of it?
ah
Used to be in butler, gone now, no longer needed
did I break something?
Hmmm, no, I updated that...did you pull?
@JoseEspinosa Are you planning on disallowing hosting assets from a path?
You'd be removing a feature.
we do allow it right now
we allowed anything that started with a slash
or not even
any string passed was allowed
says who?  I can serve my assets from wherever I want.  what if my upstream server is serving the assets on that path?
Hmmm, I guess that's fair.
you said you are forcing the protocol though?
Ok, good, as long as "//" works....
@lv yes, sign all the things with it.
woots
@JoseEspinosa sorry about all my paranoia, asset host was something that we tried to change in the past and broke prior functionality on -- taught us how tricky all the use cases actually were, thus why we kept the rules around it so loose.  I guess now with the way we serve local assets, the rules can be slightly more strict.
I see it
my eyes, they see it!
woots
I just realized something...
I can't get this file over to the windows instance unencrypted
and i can't unencrypt it in the windows instance without sending my private key to the windows instance
blargh!
secureCRT? Hmmm, lemme look that up
Hmmm
brillian!
brilliant!
blargh
Windows wants the private key file to be converted to PVK
BUT, it obviously doesn't provide a native tool to do that...so now I have to use a third party tool to convert my private key.....jesus.
nah, only wants pvk
it's fine, I researched a bit and found a decently trusted tool to make pvk
but now I have a new problem....
yeah
because our original pem key had no password, I left the password field blank in installshield...but now it prompts for a password when you run it -.-
and even so, it says it failed to sign it...blarg
yar, t'was someone's recommendation.
....I want to cry.
...I'm assumming that if I want to change it to a passwordy key, then we need to go through this whole process again...right?
sigh
ok...I'll create a new certificate request....sorry to put you through that trouble again...
I'll make a JIRA ticket for it this time though :p
no, I tried researching, you're right, I should spend some more time playing around with it...
didn't find much, but I'll look for a while longer
yeah, that's the opposite problem
Hmm
yar, no passphrase
otherwise I would've written it down
oooh
thanks!
heh, so far :p
I can see why you find this more interesting :p
origin logs?
ah
you could make a simple heroku app that echo's the headers it gets into the html body and then create a moovweb project for it
right
Right, so you need to have control of the upstream
yar, I'll make a quick one and give you the url....
I suppose that should work
Nope, I'll work on the server anyways
just in case I'm done quickly.
@AaronLeung http://headerecho.herokuapp.com/
yar
create a project that proxies that
yup yup, simple sinatra app
https://github.com/mdayaram/headerecho
@ZhigangChen2 I think the build is broken from your commit, could you take a look?
@all compiling is complaining about undefined tritium/proto.SlugInfo
does anyone know what that is?
Aaron, did the build work for you when you made the import fix?
i did
I pulled everything a minute ago
jenkins is also failing
with same error
k
@all guys, please don't ignore jenkins build failure emails....
If the build is broken, it halts everyone's progress
The fix you made in tritium should also fix jenkins, but did you not get the notification email?
ah, i see, it's still broken
Yeah, Z is fixing it
That's fine, please check the emails next time though!  They tell you if the commit that broke it was yours.  The whole point of the emails was so that I wouldn't have to hunt people down anymore.
excellent, just want to make sure no one is ignoring the emails...
it is, lemme look
oh, really? is apollo being deployed?
I think it is
ah, that's probably it
yeah, apollo was just deployed
just kick off a rebuild
nah...we've never tried to build during a deploy before I guess
it has to be perfectly timed really
hence why probably only one of the slaves failed at it.
windows, why you make things so hard
/me cries
if it's unix based, I'm happy
ha
did not know
guys...I hate working from home so much.
yar
if I feel good tomorrow morning
i'm thinking of coming in
har
yeah, no, let's not get to that point just yet
:p
@hcatlin is there any reason why we use password authentication for ssh-ing into peabody instead of public key?
the mac-mini is not under puppet
unfortunately
:p
ugh...there's no reason why this should've broken....why is it broken >.<
@all did anybody mess around with Peabody today?
the mac mini in the ops closet
it's also our mac jenkins node
which is offline
cause it can no longer connect via ssh
yar
I can't debug this issue from home
I don't have a way to connect to the peabody machine with sudo access
If you manually try to ssh, it all works fine.
sigh
where's everyone going?
sigh
heh
I guess we'll leave this for tomorrow then...
blargh, screw it, I'm calling it a day
yar
wel;l
well*
that problem should disappear once we swap out the git server
but that is slated for a while
so yeah, for now you should file a ticket for it.
@ZhigangChen2 looks like a great reservoir of questions
Yeah, they look like it.  I'll probably pick my brain on one or two of them some time this weekend.
Any recommendations on a particularly fun one to try?
ah
This is also a good site for puzzles, it's created by some of my old professors:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/puzzle/index.html
They're mostly math puzzles, but quite fun
lol
so I have to solve all other puzzles first? crazy
that's pretty ridiculous.  though sounds like a lot of fun
man
I wish I was still in college, problems were always phrased in fun puzzle format :p
haha, that's true...not a very good test-taker myself
Hmm, all these puzzles remind me of the days of LateX
I had to write everything up in LaTex, ugh, can't even remember how it was capitalized
oh my, this one doesn't even have a problem statement
lol
I thought the message at the bottom was a clue as to how to fill in the blanks above >.>
Man, I'm rusty
@MichaelCatlin I'm going to get lunch, can you take the support issue from here?
I wasn't able to find anything meaningful unfortunately
yep, good luck!
ooooh
weirdo
Hmmm, i wonder if it has to do with that PR that Zhigang merged in from that random guy.
I see
yeah, I didn't make one
(on purpose)
[dun dun dun]
We didn't need it anymore
yar
@AaronLeung I wiped the workspace and kicked off a new build
it looks like it's going ok
lemme see....
Hmm, I'll try to take a look at it, might take me a while since I'm not familiar  with that code at all, and it looks like it might be a libxml issue?
Also, it looks like we have a few issues in gokogiri, @ZhigangChen2 can you go through them and categorize them as things we'll do and things we...won't do I guess? Closing the ones we wont' do.  We should create JIRA issues for the ones we will tackle.
@AaronLeung no
Different issue about parsing fragments
hipchat still autocompletes to @AaronLeung
maybe I have to refresh
@Aaron there we go
yep
I refreshed, it's @Aaron now
you'll have to ping him
in person
Looks like it was an issue introduced by a bad build of gokogiri.
I would try, deleting all the repos except the one you're trying to build and run the build script again.
you'd have to
go test ambrosia/transform --mixer="mixer-name" --test-data=/path/to/ambrosia/test
hmm
one sec
sorry, I got those backwards....
go test ambrosia/test --mixer=simple-mobile --test-data=/path/to/ambrosia/transform
yar...if you use relative path, i think it has to be relative against where the test is being run, not relative to your current dir
the namespace thing, or the import hing?
ah, cool
Hmmm, what is the effective change?
Hmm, in tritium, how could you exploit this?
I think as long as all our older tests pass (including the legacy mixer tests), I think we should be fine, though for completeness sake, we probably want to have a small write up on the change, the effects on tritium, and make sure that that makes it to the changelog of 4.3
the writeup could be as simple as "here's a test case, before it would do this, now it does that" kind of thing, just as long as people are aware that 4.3 does this differently.
locally is not possible yet because it has to fetch each previously released mixer.
But the basic idea is this:  put only the mixer you're testing in your .moovweb/mixers folder, then checkout ambrosia for the tag of that mixer, and run the tests like you would normally (using the latest test runner compiled against master tritium, this means you'll have two copies of ambrosia repo, one running the tests, and the other containing tests specific to a mixer).
did that make sense?
cool
@all signing off.  Gonna try to make it in tomorrow!  See you.
I sees
macys people, always having problems
mo money mo problems
they might have to update their brew version (maybe)?
oh
mac os X
Hmmm
I believe we've only tested in snow leopard and above
anything below that we have no idea if it works or not.
alternatives for what? what do you mean?
oooh
right, the X Code Command line tools
I think pre snow leopard, they'd have to install all of XCode
oh yeah, if they're using powerpc, all bets are off
Well, we just don't know if it would work or not, but is very likely that complications will arise.
ok, then it won't work :p
@MichaelCatlin manan seems to be not responding =/
wait wait wait
if she has snow leopard
she should be able to get xcode
how is she trying?
weeeeeird
Hmmm, i dunno, that's weird
she probably needs to download an earlier version of xcode
yeah
https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey\n
woops
wrong link
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11198641/xcode-for-snow-leopard-where-to-get
there
that tells you how to download older versions of xcode
finally
wooooooooo
NOW TO GET LUNCH!
woo
uei said it worked for him
double win
cool
tested out?
you can run the same script to test it out locally
excellent, give me one second and I'll deploy it.
yar, np
@MichaelCatlin sorry, it looks like there's a lot of changes that have gotten into the deploy branch for the generator
I'm a little hesitant releasing all of them, as they look rather involved
no, other people have been committing to it
so
we can still release your fix
it's just gonna be slightly more complicated =/
no, that's ok
Hmmm, actually, I think I can do it.
have to isolate your fix in its own branch, and we'll release that one.
ok, I'll deploy just that commit.
@MichaelCatlin Can you do me a favor and test your fix again
by checking out the branch "js_add_assets_fix" instead of deploy
thanks
okie dokes, it's going out!
ok, the fix should be live in prod right now
could you generate a new project using the SDK and make sure it's working fine?
/me forgot to @MichaelCatlin for the above messages >.>
cool, thanks
Hmm, what do you mean by not reaching moovcloud?
weird, can you try again?
phew
ok
, that's good
still odd that it failed the first time though =/
Hmmm, I guess that would be either me or Z
sure
Hmmm
noice
yup, lemme see.
it sounds like they're doing it right.
me!
sure, no problem, just grab me
yeah, that was silly, oh well, at least now we know =)
k, cool
@MichaelCatlin project name can't start with a number
yep
hampton, sean, ajay, jaja, chris mague (unless we removed him from the list), I think that's it.
gitolite indeed
maybe juan has the power too
indeed
I'll bug le Hampton.
hampton is in a meeting ='(
We can make an ops ticket for it?
woot
lol, yeah, it's ok
I"m still completely mystified as to what's going on
did he reply? I didn't see any in my email
yeah....honestly though, I have no clue what could be going on with him...that case is rather puzzling.
@NaseemMakiya @MichaelCatlin sorry, meant to mention that in here
Yeah, we'll let you know
like myself
rerun moov login
um, well, it's really a choice of which key he wants to use, but if you want to keep the defaults, I would say use id_rasa
id_rda*
yar
yep
weird, what version of moov is he running?
if it's something older than 4.1, tell him to upgrade
?
I see
well
solution if you don't want to upgrade:
rm ~/.moovweb/keys/authorized_keys
then run moov login
k
cool
^.^
thankee!
@MichaelCatlin @NaseemMakiya we're having trouble rolling back apollo, will let you know when that's done.
but for now, you can consider it in a somewhat borked state, avoiding pushing to moovcloud is advised (though mostly just because the push will fail)
yeah
probably is
yep
yeah, have they been tested locally?
k, thanks
ok, just let me know when it's good to go and I can deploy it.
@NaseemMakiya @MichaelCatlin I changed the name of the template from "mtv" to "googletv" in the js_blah_blah_fix branch
yup, no problem. I told mat about the update, hopefully we'll get it out by tomorrow morning.
yo
sure
done!
@all manning the support room from the hackfest is rather difficult, the internet here is too crappy, can someone take a look at the support room and answer any questions that come up?
@TarunDesikan are you around?
laptop under my desk
I think it's the one at the top
what should I tell him?
k
@MichaelCatlin @NaseemMakiya I'm releasing the newest mixer version for the generator
simple-mobile 1.0.183
The previous version was 1.0.94
@MichaelCatlin @NaseemMakiya nevermind, reverted the chagne.
@MichaelCatlin it's not intentional, but a known issue.
@HariAnanth http://noj.cc/p/graph-animator
Hmm
weird
lemme try running it locally
@LV looks like it's slightly off, whenever I run it, it's always one number behind
which is weird...
oh
It's OK now
can you force a run in icinga now?
ugh
I'll look into it
yedgyz
yeah
don't advertise the reddit site yet!
I think we should wait for april fools >.>
Also, I don't know if my slow loading server can handle a lot of requests :p
Hmm
@Ishan I like your idea for April fools much more
I think if we're doing something for April fools, we should do just one thing and commit to it
Sooooooooooooooo, OK, @hcatlin feel free to tweet away :p
Why does Hari not want followers?
hahaha
I was thinking of changing it
but that would unlink all my other tweets
so my previous @ mentions would be broken
yeah
I tried it for a second
and it broke all of them.
so I quickly changed it back :p
People tweeting "@yedgyz blah blah blah"
that tweet would no longer be linked to me
because the "@yedgyz would lead to a broken page"
Hmmm
I should ask my twitter friends about it
Hmmm
if I change my name
I would probably just get yedgyz anyways
so I would end up with two
yedgyz is, afterall, my defacto username when all my normal stuff is taken
My roommate said that @ mentions definitely don't get updated
so, I think _noj is also available
ugh
If I'm going to change my name, I rather change it to something I'm happy with, I don't want to change it to _noj_ :p
ha
:p
I'm sure once I get super popular, people will remember yedgyz :p
simple way to remember:
Think of "edgy"
now add a y
and trail a z
done
yedgyz
so simple
:p
hahaha
haha
Hmm
well
heheheh
ahaha
Ishan knows where it's up
Hmm
well
I'm not against changing it
if there's a good alternative
is mdayaram taken?
It is....but hasn't tweeted in two years
I can probably ask my roommate to nab that for me.
ugh
but that's kind of boring.
Hmm
@hcatlin are you waiting for me to change my name before tweeting about this? :p
I think so too, unfortunately it's taken by someone who's way more active in twitter than me :p
ok ok, I'll do the double underscore :p
lol
guy who took "noj" is actually called "john"
alrighty, have a blast :p
/me needs to remember where in the web he has to update his handle now
lol
I feel like changing your online nickname on twitter is almost like changing your mailing address
gotta update it for your bank, your work, your gym membership, your doctor's office, etc... :p
@ZhigangChen2 I used to know of this really cool site where you would describe your start up and it would come up with a jazzy web 2.0 name for it, but I can't find it anymore =(
After all that talk, I still see no one tweeting @ my new username
sure there is
I do that all the time
what does your config.json look like?
also, thanks @SeanJ for tweeting at me :p
Looks like the hostnames are taken.
Also, I haven't tried using the hostvar in the middle
that's kind of weird
but theoretically should work
Lemme test it out
oh
then just don't use the dollar sign
then remove the extra "a"
if you leave the dollar sigh
I see
lol
I would do
actually, can you have a blank hostvar in a project?
(in apollo)?
is that what you tried to do?
Also, @hcatlin your tweet is wrong
I'm not proxying hacker news
I'm proxying reddit
:p
:p
also, @MichaelCatlin that is my new favorite
lol
so many corrections
oh wells
I retweeted it.
:p
haha
"sell your privacy" implies it was yours to sell, it's already mostly likely public :p
@hcatlin you around? I have a quick question
@Aaron http://www.fitabase.com/i/moovfit
@Aaron https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9921601/moovweb/perfect_bits.txt
ah
true that
cool
@LV http://mhlui4357.fitabase.com.moovapp.com/c/2218680c-db37-4226-8670-0b3370bdfea9/challenge
@SeanJ your phone rang
definitely
what is the best venue to announce this?
bringing it up in the discussion
@MatB me and Hari decided that we should have a celebratory shot on every "successful" apollo deploy
that's wrong
If he's getting a URL like that, it means he's doing something funky in tritium
I believe there's an asset mixin or something, ask @Aaron
funky man
g'night!
woots
Thanks @juan
cool
oooh
what does that mean?
ah, fun fun
yeah, that sounds like it will work a lot better
i hopes
no idear
Aaron would be a good person to talk to about it, or Dr. Z
Hmm
yeah, I saw the email
but it in the docs for now
but I think the ideal thing to do is to make sure that the bundled installer is installed using those options
can you make a JIRA issue about it?
put it under 4.3 for now, but it's possible that it'll get pushed to 4.4
nope
no builds triggered if you only push to tritium
If you want to run the tritium tests, you should kick off a build of manhattan
yup yup
np
can't
@hcatlin said it's fully booked
yup, oh wells
oh
i have strong opinions about that :p
well
at least my roommates and feminist friends do
(on how they don't like the feminist culture in engineering)
no worries
Yeah, it'll be nice to get that updated, it's been very unhelpful for a very long time :p
@MichaelCatlin let me know when you need it pushed
cool, I'll get started now
@MichaelCatlin all updated, try it out
cool
woot
188 was built against 4.2
Hmm, i'd have to take a look
most jobs should not be built with anything other than master
in fact, it's an error on our part that the mixer stuff is not backwards compatible
yeah
I made those today
tritium tester needs to be versioned with the SDk
since it needs to match the tritium engine that's deployed in productoin
but the mixers should be independent, hence having different jobs for them is contradictory to our contract
so we'll have to figure out exactly why it fails.
but for now, this is a stopgap
@SeanJ Please pre-release 4.2.192 whenever you get the chance.
yeah, it's good shit
@NaseemMakiya prerelease is out
@ZhigangChen2 real fix should be in.
looks good on your end?
hey
hold on
@hcatlin you around?
I have a ruby question
er
about the generator specifically
It's...slightly...too involved to google...
np
@SeanJ support room, someone's asking about carousels, I don't know anything about that, and Michael is out.
so is Naseem it seems
nvm
@ZhigangChen2  you around?
@all https://twitter.com/_noj_/status/310200849718718465
I sent an email yesterday
peabody is not setup yet.
uhhhhh
don't remember
what do you mean?
jenkins jobs running on master node should be fine
but anything that runs on mac is screwed
yar
someone please look at it before I merge in
it would make me feel that much better :p
DOING IT
Aaron gave me the OK
they have been merged!
@hari changes are in tritium and ambrosia, please go ahead and move your URL functions to ambrosia.
I recommend making an internal mixer that simple mobile depends on (kind of like uranium)
cool
yeah
my fun is called to_json_v1_
and the name is just "to_json_v1"
that seemed to be the convention from what I saw in all the other fuctions
functions*
(I'm guessing to differentiate from functions that will be used as native tritium functions and helper functions in the same package).
correct
@ZhigangChen2 test case is in the xml2json branch
feel free to play with it whenever
@ZhigangChen2 http://headerecho.herokuapp.com/stuff?hi=hi&amp;there=there
http://headerecho.herokuapp.com/stuff?hi=hi&there=there
I was gonna send an email
I'm on call for today since Z is OOO
cube chatter!
yup yup
you can assign to me
generator and login are mostly me now (if it's SDK related)
however, all error messages are funnelled through from apollo
ok, merging it in
@NaseemMakiya is live in prod, but you won't be able to use it until Apollo allows it.
for the names pace stuff, I need to prefix the dollar in $("stuf") if I'm in a different namespace, right?  like, tritium.$("stuf")
@Aaron
k
is anyone out there?
soooooooooo manies
if no one replies within an hour, I'm merging it myself :p
yay code reviews
ruby is good shit
golang is good shit on the compilez
haha
truth
I wouldn't use compiled languages too often for personal projects
cause it is an extra step to compile and deploy, and troubleshoot
but for anything that scales, it makes sense.
ooh
have you heard of Omar's little side project?
he wants to make a site dedicated to "About Moovweb"
rails project prolly
that basically advertises our culture
and has everyone's picture, maybe small snippet of themselves, etc...
we talked about this a while ago as a intranet page, but he wants to make a public facing one.
he's looking for devs :p
I said I would help out, but my time is pretty drained, so I'm not sure if I could keep up with his velocity.  And in general, more devs is good :p
prolly
and then just CNAME it.
hahaha
donezo
latest version?
cool!
hm
weird
lol
yeah, it's the auth token
if you delete it
and run moov login again
it
it'l be ok
weird
oh bugs, so lovely.
lemme look at the apollo code
actually
that code was recently changed
so I have no idea what's in prod right now.
is there any way to find out what version is in prod?
It's blank
Home shows nothing, apps shows nothing too =(
ah
I used my google apps
oooh, you stealing my datas?
:p
cool
omg
is this a generic deployment mechanism?
i hope you didn't give me access to deploy to staging
yes, what I meant to say is "did you write a generic deployment mechanism" :p
so mps can be deployed by this as well? and tritium tester?
and all our apps?
it took away everything
can't see anything anymore
however, I can still see the "New Application" button
are you using rolify? I believe that's what we use in apollo
neat
I see
oh well
still pretty cool
I'm excited to deploy all our stuff through there :p
I'm assuming Noopy will still be used for logs, graphs, and stats?
and Appy will just be deployment?
ah, cool
and you were looking for shit to code?  Looks like Appy needs your loves :p
anywho, probably should concentrate on the apollo deploy :p
that didn't sound scary at all
cool
yup, the file you're interested in is scripts/pages/product.ts
lemme see
yes
let me mark as validate
cool, thanks
I believe...
/var/run/mps.pid
looks good?
ah, ok, did it fail to run? or did it keep running even though it failed to write it's pid?
probably should hard fail in that scenario methinks.
that would explain the nooppy errors
Hmm
lame
well, I guess it's not super urgent now, but I'll add a ticket to make sure we hard fail on that
no?
Hmm
the way I saw it, if we failed to write the pid, it means we'll just have more failures in the future (fail to restart the proxy because pid was not found, etc...)
Hmm
Hmm, I can see it both ways, uptime is definitely important, but I'm also worried about not being able to kill it properly on certain scenarios
I guess as long as we have a mechanism to clobber it that doesn't depend on the pid, that would work, but then the point of the pid is somewhat moot
yeah, but kill -9 what pid? :p
lol
yeah, but the point that we introduced a pid file was so that you wouldn't have to do that :p
okie doke then, I'll leave it as is
heh, fair enough
yup
I think you did ask way back when :p
woot
now lemme try a curl
yup yup
Hmmm
curling doesn't seem to work
ah
cool, it's working
hmm
yeah
the default
is /var/run/mps.pid I think
oh wait
you want it to NOT write the pid if the option is not passed?
yeah, I think it probably just doesn't have perms to write in /var/run
neato
ah
Hmm
so you have to run mps in sudo, that's kind of lame
and you manually set the perms in /var/run/mps to the user?
Hmmm
I can't change the install scripts right now, or at least, I don't feel comfortable changing them at this stage
but I can change the default place the pid gets written to.
sounds good.
so I can make a new build of MPS where the default pid is /var/run/mps/server.pid
and then you guys can change the perms in puppet for /var/run/mps
sound reasonable?
Hmm, ok, but just FYI, that would be pretty simple on our end.
i see
mps uses flags instread of a conf file :p
Hmmm
is that script a puppet script?
the first one
I see
yeah
so would you change the stop script to use the pid file then?
yeah, we suddenly have to make sure all these scripts know this tidbit of info
we can make MPS read a conf instead of using flags, that wouldn't be too hard, would just go into 4.4
right
would you guys prefer a conf file?  I can make a ticket for it
oh, so you want to output a conf?
oh, I see
nevermind
I get it
well, the technical details on how MPS would read the conf file are whatever, but yeah, I can make a ticket for it to make sure we get that for 4.4
I'll add a note on the ticket to discuss with you about implementaion/format ideas :p
ah, truth.
it would require change to the packaging though, which is slightly trickier :p
lol, so what you're saying is that you don't want me to do anything then? :p
I believe they're already working on a config file for onpremise
I figured onpremise would just be MPS with a slugmanager that reads projects given a root directory, but apparently it's more complicated than that.
meh, if we really need it, I can pick it up and finish it off, but I still think it's catered to a rather small market, and it's also putting us at risk of having someone use it to host their own stuff.
true
yeah
those are our two options
you sure?  I was *about* to change the default just now, had vi open and everything
lol, ok, no worries, I'll leave it for now then.
looks like giediservers are working too, so I'm gonna close both of those tickets in JIRA
oh snapple
we don't have a maximum timeout limit for giedi requests
or rather
we started out with 100ms, and then double on every subsequent request
so we should cap out at 500ms?
what seems like a reasonable value?
I'm gonna set it at 600ms for now
lol
sounds like my initial timeout should be smaller
I see, so maybe 100 is fine
and then max it out at....800, if we ever get to that point, something is terribly wrong
yeah, no worries, makes sense
neat
lol
truth
alrighty, change is in, gonna let it build and try to deploy to MPS tomorrow
alrighty, I'm heading off, laters
@SeanJ I replied to the email.
There's reason behind that, please consult Sean about it.  Or if you want to get a second hand source, I can talk to you about it
@SeanJ let me know when you've bumped the stable release
k
@SeanJ Looks good to me on the linuxes
k
@SeanJ looks good
@SeanJ please let the appropriate parties know that the has is back in the header
@LV HTTP and HTTPS
lol, you must've
supposed to be a minute
but from experience
it feels more like 5 minutes
@all guys, we need to rewrite our entire platform in LOLCODE: http://lolcode.com/
their site might be down, so here's the wiki article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE
I WISH tritium's syntax looked like that
oh snap
yar
Excellent, I'll start documenting individual questions, please feel free to edit as you see fit
guys
let's just throw a bunch of the cheapest alcohols we can find in a punch bowl and call it the Platform Punch
yeah, looks fine
it's working, they're just concerned of whether it's a 301 or a 302
looks like we do a 302
Yeah, the result is a consequence that we can't stop the proxy from going upstream
@jefe means the tritium is taking too long to execute
@JajaB http://noj.cuteoverload.com.moovapp.com/
@JajaB maybe just restart nginx?
@SeanJ you working on the https solution?
eep
well, ping me if you need my help, I'll be around, but doing other stuff.
yeah, just @ my name whenever it's ready to test
how's it going?
cool
and this is in cl02 only, right?
testing
chrome in linux is fine
gonna test IE, need to boot up my win laptop...might take a bit.
should've done this earlier, blah
while windows boots, I'll test firefox in mac
really? that's pretty sad
we really should
a lot of people still use it
okie doke
guys
I may be a victim of software counterfeiting.
I know, it's always looking out for me.
honestly, IE needs to come up with private browser sessions...this is ridiculous
oh man, grammar typo fail
"Warning:  the webpage..." should be "Warning:  The webpage..."
sorry, testing on windows is inherently slow unfortunately....
guys, internet explorer froze when I tried to close a tab
I'm so sad right now
you're right, I was being silly, I'm just opening more tabs now anyways.
FYI
the screen that IE gives users about the broken cert
looks almost identical to their internal server error page
and it freaked me out
but then I noticed that the options in the bottom were different, and you can click through
but yeah, still pretty bad
another FYI, apollo does NOT look like shit on IE
I'm impressed
I was gonna look into that.  Last time I installed it I didn't get the SmartScreen warning
but it was also while installing on a laptop that I installed on several times already
easiest way to check is to take a fresh/new laptop and try to install there and see what happens
or a VM or whatever
anyways, IE is all clear
@SeanJ you use an iOS 6 simulator?
i sees i sees
true
cools
cool
chrome on mac looks good
although, i just realized that the text we have there doesn't make any sense
in english that is, technically it's fine :P
IE looks good
I'm gonna make a JIRA ticket about our grammar :p
alrighty, if that's that, I'm going to sleep
g'night guys
guys
I'm the only one in the platform area
I feel so special
hahaha
true that >.>
@jefe you shouldn't.  It's limited for a reason, whoever has the power to do that could potentially screw up the certs for that account
@MichaelCatlin yup, thanks!
@jefe that's fair, and if you think that the best way for the team to function is by giving them all manager access, that's fine, but the was just trying to explain why we chose the defaults that way.
yeah
@Aaron already warned me about that
I mentioned that I don't always sit on the ball in the same position
I move around and will stand up a lot
pretty good
some pretty interested people
hampton's talk only
oh wells
you could've gone
but you didn't :p
truth
you're welcome
(content)
@Aaron that just looks like a very cushiony chair, you lose the benefit from it being a ball :p
it's just a chair on wheels! :p
@jefe from my understanding, we're going to collapse those into just enterprise, so there should be no difference, @all correct me if I'm wrong.
Also, pull and checkout the prod_mscaffoldv2 branch and run tests to make sure it's fine.
In the comments preferably so that we have it on record.
thnx
@Aaron I'll watch it tonight and let you know how it goes.
alas, I must validate the release
noice
I get that you wheren't expecting that.
Aaron (not @ing you cause I don't want to wake you up).  Just finished the video, it was really cool.  I always had a vague idea on how watches work, but that was really nice, getting down to the nitty gritty.
Here it is more broken down:
Logging was broken yesterday, so we couldn't investigate.  I talked to LV, he said that the number is still low overall, so we decided to wait until today to investigate
so the second graph is showing all the customers who experienced more than 25 500 responses (per minute?) at any given point in the last 48 hours
so if it was a bad customer, we'd see it in the second graph
you do see casbahia and mens wearehouse spiking
but that was later in the day
more than 25, at some point in the last 48 hours, they spiked to more than 25 errors in a minute.
so
I'm thinking it was an infra error
if you look at this graph
we have a dip in requests around the same time
that means requests were not reaching MPS
I know there was some infra problems yesterday as well, so I'll talk to Miles and Juan about it
@MichaelCatlin it's fine.
@MichaelCatlin I don't get email notifications for some reason, can you send me an email with a link so I don't forget
it is already overlayed, the 500 errors are too small to see
(by comparison)
Hey @SeanJ
This works: curl http://mdemo.neutrogena.co.uk.moovapp.com/ -H "Cookie:  catchall_landing_visited_v2=true"
But
if you browse in the network tab in chrome
the domain of the catch_all cookie is unspecified
for some reason
maybe cached?
try creating a new profile and clearing all the things
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631726/using-ldirectord-for-load-balancing-git-servers
I'll add the bit about upgrading the BB before apollo
cool, I'll test again.
annnnnoying?
hmm
I do...
hold on
(content)
@jefe correct
blargh...was supposed to work on that today, but got distracted
Hmm
not sure
hmm
gem list
?
Does golfsmith use sprites
this looks to be a sprites issue.
sup
@LV I'm here, what's up?
sure
manhattan
pushing to tritium won't kick off a new build though, so you'll want to build one manually
coo
coo
yup, they do
wootos
@all heading out for a bit, gotta go rent a mic for Hampton's talk today.  Should be back within half an hour.
yes, a mic :p
@all gotta return the mic, will be back in 30
back
@MichaelCatlin upgrading moovweb
yup yup
@hari http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy
it looks like we'd have to check X-Content-Security-Policy as well as Content-Security-Policy
haha
yeah, that seems kind of silly.
that's odd
hmm
I wonder how it became archived....
we've never archived a mixer before, nor did we ever have plans to archive any mixer
ideally we'd always host them...
yeah, must've been accidental?
I don't think there's an automated way to archive a mixer in apollo.
although
we should update the mixer in the generator as well
with the fix Hari put in
so anyone generating a new project
will not be impacted..
impacted with the github issue that is.
but that's a bigger deal, might need to go through QA
They introduced a new header to all their responses
Content-Security-Policy
which disables the execution of assets that are not from their whitelisted domains
oh
I'll audit the changes, Hari is working on a fix for the mixer though, we'll review after that fix is finished
lemme see
oh, this is the crazy one
yeah, I talked to Naseem about it already, suggested some questions to ask, let me catch up on the ticket info.
@SeanJ we're experiencing access denied issues in the build box when trying to purge edgecast.  I tried searching on their site for the validity of the auth token we're using, but I don't have enough permissions to view that section, can you take a look?
my.edgecast.com
go into HTTP Small Object
and then into Token Auth
@all making my way into the office now....@ my name in hipchat if you need me for anything
no, it can't
um, that's wrong too, it should be moovdns.net
i believe
also
that doesn't exist
I can't ping it
is this project live?
did they push to moovcloud?  They're project needs to be enterprise level for the cnames to be generated
right
true, so?
an automatic cname is not generated unless you're enterprise, but you can still point to a different cname, or an A record which will let you go live
looks like mqa2.macys.com => macys-sandbox.moovdns.net => cl01.moovdns.net => our IP
macys-sandbox.moovdns.net is not the auto-generated cname
it was probably created manually for them.
so they can use that same one if they want then
sure
tell them to run
ping macys-sandbox.moovdns.net
That will give them an IP address
though
is there a reason why that project is not enterprise?
I see
true
whatever it needs to be I suppose.
yup yup
@hari that's standard behavior for proxies
proxies handle so many requests, it would be unreasonable to keep requests alive
you'd run out of tcp connections almost immediately
and you would have to start closing them in order to take in more requests
so we just close them immediately.
the Connection: close header is to tell the server that we're talking to that we're going to close the connection
if we kept it as keep alive, we would close the connection ourselves, and the server would be like "wtf? I thought we were still talking", so we're just passing the message :p
yes, that is weird...what does it use?
(truestory)
it's 0.0.3
not 33
yup
@SeanJ Here's the route:
You need to put your authorization_token at the end of it
@SeanJ http://thefuckingweather.com/
@Aaron who should initially be allowed to create http-transformer type mixers?
lol
It gave me the weather for NY when I first went to it, you might have to input the right city :p
just realized aaron is not here
sooooooooooo
I'm going to make an executive decision
and say that we'll use the developer role for his feature for now
and we can change it later.
@hari the default is enterprise+, but for Aaron's feature I think we wanted to restrict it even further
enterprise can use the request_main.ts and response_main.ts files, that's true
well, that's fairly true
but for now, we might as well just make it slightly more restrictive.
also
creating a mixer is not associated to a project
so it's at a per user basis.
no worries, the logic is super simple
I'll make a PR for apollo for it.
yep, working on it
yar
@Aaron that is correct, but @hari 's argument is that regardless of what the customer wants to do, someone could completely change the behavior of request_ts entirely as if he had powers to create a mixer
the different here is that the creating a mixer spreads that change to anyone that uses that mixer
where as the request_main.ts import is stuck on the project
you fuck up your project, that's your fault
you fuck up other people's projects, that's on us
hence why creating a mixer with http-transforms is tied up to just us for now.
that's weird
@Aaron could you investigate?  I know that the original add_class was overriden in simple-mobile
or whoever has time really
@Aaron the feature name for the http-transform check is "http-transform"
When you call the method in the Apollo Session object, make sure you use that, the project and account names are irrelevant.
for now it will return false
but I Have a PR in apollo which will check if the user is a moovweb dev
and return the correct thing
I believe the project needs to be enterprise
yes, probably, I think.
someone at ops might know better
@hari @Aaron when you fix the add_class issue, please add a test for it
I dropped it because Hampton said that he didn't want the SDK to even have that ability
instead, he wanted comprehensive SDK tests for each SDK version in apollo
where the tests check apollo routes the way the SDK would
I think that's a better solution
let's defer that issue for 4.5 so we can discuss it.
I pushed the ticket.
@Aaron take note on which commit you're on
ahha, nice hari :p
ok
ok, so you want me to pull ambrosia and all the things
and try to build simple-mobile?
and simple-http-transformers
also
by the way
nvm
I'm silly
@Aaron mixer building was so fast I almost thought I had an error

no worries
@hari @Aaron having a meeting at 10:30 in dog patch explaining the perf stuff, you're welcome to come
noj means something completely different in the ops world
just fyi :p
Nope

found the thingy, says to email direct manager of the nominee, tony, ajay, and deb
apollo is part of platform
no biggie
:p
@JajaB that's been in place for a while
or rather
it should be in 4.4 at least
yeah
actually, it's out for 4.3
lol
just too many other things going on :p
Turn them into managers? :p
ouch
that's it, never turning 30
I will add it to my list
heh
what's up?
You're using omni-mobile instead of simple-mobile :p
I gots your back, bro ;)
^.^
(content)
nice
haha
our counter platform monit project goes to google.com :p
we give all search engines a chance
ah
we can't proxy onto a path
oh
yeah
but you can't change the status code
in main.ts
erase everything
and call
set("OK")
Hmmm, weird...
it says the content length is 26
if you hit the proxy directly, nope, it'll gzip everything
nginx respects it though
so our infra respects it, but not mps by itself
the body is probably gzipped, but it should say OK
try pushing your project to the cloud
and curling the result htere
there*
yeah, just create something in apollo and do a force push onto it.
yeah, you have to use omni mobile in moov cloud
did you add the Mixer.lock file?
Hmm
It says it was missing the file...
oh, ok
lol
nice
um
yes
I will say yes
I'm screwing with it
sorry
doing perf tests on it
nojing it hard
Hmmm, that's not cl02
that looks like cl01?
wait
I like
lied*
wait
when did the IP change?
fuck
I've been sieging the wrong ip
ok, phew
yeah
cl02 is pretty messed up right now, it's basically my test bed
cd ../../
grr
this is not my terminal
@all I'm sitting at the receptionist desk today
LOL
that does look like them
Ajay swore by them.
@JajaB that is legit investigative work
I wish we could toast moscato to that find
(content)
that entire company is just one giant troll
(troll)
oh, cool
that was fast
how did you fix it?
heh
cool, thanks Aaron!
ooh, so we're deploying multiple mixers?
were these tested against 4.4.77?
@SeanJ ?
okie dokie
k
also
@SeanJ usually we only update the base recipe (which would also update the mobile and advanced recipes).  Do we want to update the scaffold and moovweb recipes as well?
ok
So the following recipes will not receive the updated mixer:
moovweb, jqm, googletv, mobile-scaffold, tablet
@SeanJ all done
existing wouldn't change, this is a generator update, not build-related
I just generated a project, it got the new mixers
the error message for bad SDK versions is weird though
I think it should be more specific, like
"The mixer versions you're using require and SDK of version 4.4 or greater.  Please update at { link }"
the current error message is super confusing.
hold on, lemme check with 4.4 to make sure normal func works
i dunno
It was prereleased
yeah, I know that
weird
oh
mat can pretend to be you?
fancy
Are the mixers released?
lemme try to download 44.77
@SeanJ ok, seems to be working
@all play.tritium.io looks wicked awesome!
The tabbing is still broken =(
also, not being able to view the transformed source is le sad
=(
thanks
@SeanJ http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status&ts=1370972143529
sadness
(lemon)-///-o
/me is a persistent fellow.
thankee
Not in tritium, but in gokogiri
it appears that way.
why, is there history behind it?
summary?
hmm
@TarunDesikan Yeah, namespace support in tritium probably requires a lot more work and testing.  The only thing the PR I merged in did was add a function to add a namespace to a node through gokogiri library, but we're not exposing that in tritium and probably won't given the complications.
Push off?
well
you can have all three
you can have simple-http-transformers, jsonlib, and simple-mobile
in fact, I would recommend that setup
over just simple-http and simple-mobile
Hmm
well
I think
you're right
well
if the generated recipe includes simple-mobile in it
then I think we're fine
as long as the recipes contain the mixers that they need to work out of the box
it's ok
if you delete mixers from the Mixer.lock file after generating it, then obviously things won't work.
Because the recipes should be built with the minimum mixers required to work.
right
same thing with Gemfiles
mixers are libraries
you want something new, you add mixers, usually you don't remove
@MatB that would be mostly @hari methinks
Sorry, I'm out of the office at the moment, is everything resolved?
@MichaelCatlin yeah, just grab me whenever
@hcatlin @MatB @JajaB you don't want to look at *just* the host_registration, but also the hostmap_registration
they both take super long the more host_map rules you have
Our two biggest bottlenecks on builds right now are projects that use compass and have complicated sass, and host map registration
wierd
I know pontofrio took like several minutes
are thsese stats from just this week, or since forever
that makes sense, since no huge host projects have been pushed recently
I see
well
from the logs
it looks like it was slow due to compass
I think
from what I saw
You didn't make that
your mom did
LIAR
no access
readme fails
No worries =D
Although, I forgot to mention, that the above doesn't work in all cases (like if you have your host variable in the middle of your hostname, like hi.$.nytimes.com)
There's no 100% reliable way to find out your host variable unfortunately.
None that I can think of, but I also wasn't part of the conversations about it when the decision was made.  I can make a JIRA issue about it and discuss it with Sean and Hampton to find out whether it's a good idea or not.
yup yup (content)
yep, should be 4.5
Needs 4.5 + new mixers
Yup
I actually was reading that very article
@SeanJ if we're making new jira issues for bugs/etc... but are not sure what sprint/release they should go to, what should we label them as?
er, what fix version should we put in them?
and if it's a feature?
ok, so...err on overscheduling then
so aaron should've given you access, let us know if it works
nope
I hate fun
(dumb)
@hcatlin did you get my email about the assumptions?
@hcatlin

@hcatlin did you get my email about the assumptions, I await your acknowledgement.
omg! when did that become a emoticon!
(ceilingcat) ftw!
Hmmm, I'd have to look into it to really tell you why
but it's true that the url scheme we use should automatically cache bust
That can be one of the things we look into when trying to speed up our build process
but for now, that's still a very quick step compared to other things
hmm
<br/>
thanks
We don't have a mechanism to do that as of yet
or rather
I'm not sure if mixers can access response_main.ts
I do think that having a standard mixer being capable of accessing that part would be super useful at times
and would decrease code duplication a lot (instead of making a ton of core-rewriter mixer duplicates to add a simple feature, new normal lib mixers could just use request_main.ts or something.
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to do that unless you wrote a core rewriter
(today that is)
you could upload it anywhere really.
yeah, we totally talked about that
JIRA issue or it ain't happening ;)
feel free to use all caps in JIRA
weeeeee
did you assign it to a fix version?
no fix version, then it won't get done ;)
lame sauce
i got it too
I just made two of those :p
@SeanJ you around?
Amit and Greg need to get JIRA and hipchat accounts
they also got their build working, what bugs did you want them to work on?
Did you have a set, or do you want me to just pick something random off the 4.6 queue?
@AmitJoshi @GregoryPinto feel free to ask any questions about anything in here
@AmitJoshi I'm looking for your bug right now, I'll let you know about it in a bit.
@SeanJ weighed
@GregoryPinto Go into ~/.gvm/scripts/gvm-check
in there, change the binutils check to check for the "gar" binary instead of the "ar" binary
and then see if it works
i have helped!
(content)
4.4
um, lemme check which one exactly
yep, BB is 4.4.77
Everything under assets folder gets pushed to the cloud
but
scss files get compiled and moved into the .css directory
where ass a css file in stylesheets will most likely remain there
so you'd have to adjust the import path to account for that
(I think, @Aaron is this right?)
@hcatlin I had a dream on Sunday night where we both died.
granted, it wasn't by eggs, but rather, by the hands of a giant robot.
@Aaron sounds pretty normal to me :p
brown spots on muffins are the best
oh man, that would've been epic
but nope, pretty generic 50 foot tall robot
we were at the roof of a building
and I was there
and I got everyone to run away
and the robot was climbing the building like king kong
and then hampton showed up somehow
and then we both kinda just sat there waiting for the robot to get to the top
and when it did, the whole building collapsed
it was cray cray
I like the muffin dream better
I didn't hurt you, it was the robot!
@SeanJ http://turntable.fm/51dddba7eb35c1575c1d39b0
puppet?
503 could mean lots of things.  Are you getting a page returned?  Does the page say anything?
@MichaelCatlin it's up for me =/
could've been a service disruption
ah
ok
cool
@SeanJ it's not upgraded yet
: p
cool
Mixer.lock updates are done in 4.6 thanks to @AmitJoshi ^.^
sure
it would've automatically started
If you pushed to ambrosia
not only that
it's building ALL the mixers :p
woop woop
from core-rewriter to what?
I prefer irn-bru
I'll go ahead and make the change
I think everyone will be ecstatic about it
we can throw it in the keynote too
"You've heard of simple-mobile, and simple-http-transformers, but have you ever wondered...what happened to irn-bru? Well no more!  Behold, your very own new and shiny irn-bru-t.engine!"
@hcatlin nope
@hcatlin building is automatic, deploying is manual, once it's done I have to deploy it to apollo for you to see it.
@hcatlin it's done building, deploying now
You should see it in a minute
nevermind, deploy failed :p
investigating
oh, that's weird
building failed of the cache mixer
set_json needs to be called in a Text scope
you're calling it in an XMLNode scope, it should be called outside the html(){..} function
cool.

@SeanJ that is freaky.
My hero in life: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyARHscb8mU
@G3 malt M&Ms up in herr
@all
?
did someone order a keyboard
someone told me they were getting one but I forgot who
it's here :p
I worked on it
It's very likely something I did caused the regression
I didn't add any body tags myself, but most of the fragment stuff did have code to wrap stuff in body tags
it's possible it wasn't called before but it is now.
I guess not
@SeanJ I have an..interesting issue.
you around?
@SeanJ please ping me whenever you're free, I need to talk about the html_fragment regression bug.
so
I can revert change i made and that brings us back to how things behaved in 4.4
however, that breaks jsonlib if you try to use jsonlib inside an html_fragment
the only people that I've told about that being fixed was Sasha from Fuzz
but it was something that they requested, so I'm not sure if they're using it or not
I tried to fix the jsonlib mixer to work even with the html_fragment thing undone, but I couldn't do it.
so
the fix is in gokogiri
it's possible, but that would require some code dup on the gokogiri and engine side
but
the scope of this bug is still really small
sorry, what I meant was
the fix which I did which caused the regression was for a bug we experienced while trying to parse html_fragment and selecting the root node there
undoing my fix in order to fix the regression is what we should do, no doubt about it.
but that will break using jsonlib in html_fragment because jsonlib needs to select the root node
I'm saying that the jsonlib breakage is OK
and I would rather not add a mixer fix in order to make jsonlib work in html_fragment
if we can avoid it
it's a regression that lasted like a week.
*a regression of a feature that was only out a week
and only announced to a single group of people
right
and I could change the code
because the mixer is still experimental, so breakages are expected (this is my justification).  At the end of the day, these problems will also be fixed once we have native json support.
also, gokogiri is open source
I would rather not pollute it with random branches of code which are known to be buggy
fair enough
well
for the longest time
they were using it without html_fragment support
no
it would only break if they're using html_fragment
which is unlikely
considering they've only had a week to play with it.
and they had basically already finished their entire app without it
Yes, I agree, we should check with them.
ok, so I guess I'll ping Jeff and sasha about it.
@SeanJ Does this sound OK?
Hey guys,\n\nI just wanted to check on whether you've gotten a chance to test out the latest jsonlib mixer with the html_fragment function.  We tried to fix the crash you guys were seeing when trying to do that, but it seems that we may have introduced some other problems by doing so.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to get an idea of how prevalent you guys have used html_fragment with jsonlib so far so that we can more accurately decide what to do next on our end.\n\nThanks,\n\nManoj
Hmm, ok, what are the git uris?
k
belkapi-prod doesn't use it
neither does fairmont
you said Honie worked on it?  lemme ping him
is this for the app or the website?
hmm, honie is away
Pavan said he doesn't know, I'll ask Honie when he gets back
Yup, gnc doesn't use jsonlib
so
they wanted to use jsonlib on html fragments
but that caused the mixer to crash
engine crash*
I found out that it was because of the way we parse html fragments and how we fail to set the root node in them
but in the interim, they just found a workaround
I don't know what you mean by submission
oh
no
this is not that
that issue was a concern about speed
that was different
speed improvements to jsonlib were independent from the fragment thing
Yep
Yes, definitely, but I think the right way to do it would be to wait for the native json support, which should be coming in by 4.7, right?
and since a workaround exist (just using html instead of html_fragment), I'm not too worried about it.
k
so
the other thing that I want to do
is make sure that the project that caught this break still works after the undoing of the fix.
Because I was told that they changed their code in order to fix the issue they were having
I want to make sure that whatever changes they made, it still works after I undo the fix.
ok
So I'll test that stuff out locally, and if we're all good, I'll commit/push the changes to 4.5 and deploy the version that comes out of that, and we can go through the movements of releasing that to all the clusters tomorrow.
Sound good?
Yeah, will do.
moov compile succeeded with exit status zero.  That's as far as I know
This wouldn't be the asset server
this is moov compile
different entry point
moov compile needs to be stricter than the asset server
hmm
lemme take a quick look at it to see if we're tossing away any errors
I see
yeah
if we get an error
we're just logging it
but we don't error out the build
but
I think we did that on purpose because warnings showed up as errors as well?
yeah, in moov compile
yeah
That part of the code hasn't changed since June of 2012
We've always behaved that way
well, I think the reason was because back in the day we had a bunch of errors from bourbon, but they were all techinically warnings
but I can't be sure
Hmm, maybe it was compass
Regardless, I feel weary exiting non-zero now since it's been a longstanding behavior
@SeanJ I don't think we should release the moov compile fix for 4.5
yes :p
Hmm, what happened to @SeanJ ? did he run to a meeting?
ok, well, when he gets back, tell him that doing the moov compile fail is a bad idea to do as a hotfix.
because of the reasons we talked about above
I don't mind changing the behavior to fail the build going forward, but not for a hotfix...let's do it for 4.7
we need to test to make sure we don't fail builds that currently pass with compass warnings and the like
cool
build box uses 4.5.72
what's the problem, that you're seeing the errors locally but not when you push?
@superkev are you using 4.5.72?
you need to use 4.5.72 and the latest core-rewriter mixers
I think
tritium tester I think has the list of the latest
yeah
use the ones Michael linked
they all support that
but you shouldn't have to use request_main.ts to use static paths
Yeah
70 has a bug
you have to update to 72
@G3 added more comments, take a look
>.> It's not on apollo yet, but BB side of it is done.
Actually, I lied
I haven't made the changes to use build_id instead of version
so technically it's not done.
file a ticket!
so
It might be live for 4.6, since this is a BB related thing and I can dev it in the middle of 4.6 QA and release it
BUT
there is a caveat
You'll only be able to roll back to a build that was pushed after I make the changes
@cneale we can talk more about this in 4.7 if you have that assigned to you.
yeah, well, technically it's done, just done using versions instead of build_id :p
It shouldn't take too long, just overloaded for the rest of this week
Yeah, it shouldn't take me more than a few hours once I decide to tackle it.
I would say
Before you get started
come talk to me
and we'll talk about how it'll work
and you can go ahead with it
even if it's not implemented yet
and I'll make sure to get it in before the apollo deploy
yeah, that's what I'm hoping for, same script, different params
k, one sec
by new, you mean 4 or so months old, then yea :p
yup, github isssues
I like blamemat
we can get Colin to design a blamemat icon
I think in groupon they had a video of one of their coworkers screwing something up, and their "manager" kicking their ass for it
whenever their site was down
I thought that was funny
they probably don't do that anymore though
@MichaelCatlin best idea ever
ah, yeah
I just got stuff from everyone, haven't compiled it to a coherent log yet
lemme do that now
k
send email
sent*
we don't unless you use the flag --ssl-verify=false
but in production, we'll always verify
so the local flag is just to aid in development
@all
do we care about "moov mixer upgrade" ?
Is this still a useful feature?
I was thinking of removing it all together
considering that as of right now, it only deals with single mixers in your lock file
well
I could remove it from the command list
but keep the code there
Hmmm, lemme talk to Sean or hcat about it :p

they're both possible
we haven't changed anything in that process because we never really found out what the root cause was.
show me
@Aaron two files
giediservers
and
slugservers
hmmmmmmm
so the error message is rather specific
which means that the parameters are pretty accurate
and that it's not a general error from bad input
are you use that the user that has access is ryounes?
it's possible he has two users in his computer
and when he does a git push, it automatically uses the ssh key for the user that doesn't have access

From @MatB : http://interrobeng.com/2013/08/25/speed-up-git-5x-to-50x/
hey @all, still feeling pretty icky, but figured I'd come online in case anyone needed me for questions or what have you.
there are ways
yes
I can make that happen if you like
so
this is how I imagine it happening
you have a project
you compile your trimmed slug
and you add it to the git repo of your project
and then you push
in the build box
I'll add a little exception
if project is X and pusher is Aaron and a special file called "trimmed.slug" exists, use that slug instead of the compiled one.
snacky?
yeah, well, it's for testing, so it doesn't have to be robust :p
the other option
wich is easier
is if you send me the trimmed slug
I can just scp it over to the slug server :p
or rather
if you send jaja the trimmed slug
he can do that
he'll scp it over to the appropriate project
and sync it across all slug servers
and viola
much simpler
yes, generate your own test project and do that :p
yes
just duplicate an existing project onto your console account
it'll be something like
maaron2342424.blah.moovapp.com
yep
this is very reminiscent of mean girls
yeah, well, too much fame too soon
just look at miley cyrus
same deal
oh my
she is….well, I guess she's the most popular she's ever been
but also terrible in oh so many ways
hmm, not that I know of
@aj have you discussed with Sean about what to do about captain proto?
ok…so it sounds like we wont' have much to say about captain proto for tomorrow's meeting
@SeanJ it doesn't seem like we have much info on captain proto for tomorrow, I don't think we'll be able to present anything.
Anyways, @aj just let him know of our position, obviously stuff came up and we couldn't really work on it.
I'm getting somewhat tired again, so I'll be signing off.
thanks

mua
all
no way to target specific domains unfortunately
yep yep
@hcatlin we had originally planned to upgrade our version of go from 1.0.3 to 1.1.2 for the 4.7 release
given that we wanted to make that the super stable bugfree version, I'm starting to feel like we should delay the update to 5.0
mostly the general benefits of better gc, better performance, better api
nothing is really groundbreaking though
performance was negligeable (when comparing 1.0.3 with 1.1 that is)
yeah, that's what I thought too
okie dokie

@aj http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7701339/parse-html-with-xmllibxml-while-not-touching-entities
Hmmm
we could setup some kind of automatic mixer discovery, building, and testing framework....but that would be wonky....I would rather make it explicit that we're creating a new mixer and have people actually create a jenkins job for it, whether it's publicly released or not.
@hcatlin would you be opposed to making an engine change that enforces going to SSL upstream if the request originally came via SSL?
right now we enforce this but it's dependent of the core-rewriter.
aka, the request.ts script
I'd like to make it a permanent engine thing that cannot be changed via tritium.
k, doing it.
cool, thnx Sean
@aj http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client
@m You should download and install this:  http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client
@SeanJ or @hcatlin can one of you look over my PR for gokogiri?  I'd just like another set of eyes on it.  It should be a harmless change, but, you know, code reviews, they're a good thing.
shows up fine for me
windows is taking its time
ew
@SeanJ that happens every now and then when we try to rebuild the gem or debian index because we have so many records....just rerunning the job should be fine.
uhhh
I think it should work either way
https and non https
hmmmmm
weeeeird
Hmmm, that would be an OPS request, probably an noopy API call
yep yep
@MichaelCatlin is hampton ooto today?
=(
no way to contact him, eh?
oh snapple
wel
wll
well
I sent an email
so hopefully it's ok.
@all today is a beautiful day, and since the work I'd like to get done today does not necessarily involve a computer, I'll be working outside, prolly by the water
If anyone needs me, please ping me in hipchat
I should get a notification on my phone
also
if anyone wants to join me, but needs wifi, I'm willing to change my outdoor working location
if you know of a cafe or something with wifi
fyi, I'm back
had to pee
:p
I have a meeting at 1
@SeanJ what demos are we showing?
Is that it?
@aj found something neat
If you want to import a package but don't want to use any of the methods in it
you can use an underscore on the import
_ "encoding/image/gif"
then you don't have to add a noop instruction
Indeedy
yar
@superkev yes
it makes a request to the asset server
it's actually going to be 4.8 :p
@all John McAffee, most interesting man in the world: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg
BB is in noopy

sorry
no
nevermind
it's in appy now
Your speed was: 75wpm.\n\nYou made 1 mistake
I aggree with Greg
I slowed down a lot because of mistakes I made
that I backspaced to fix
but I usually catch those as I'm typing them if I'm looking at what I'm typing
where as in here I only noticed them every other word or so
Hmm
ask the Jaja for them, but I can deploy now if you want
yeah, it's worked fine before
deploying
updating puppet success
updating gem...
succees
s
k
did we test out whether the block worked?
okie doke
btw
@JajaB your deploy system is the bestests <3
heh
Hm
yeah
so
the bugfix was
that if there was an error in the gosass.Compile(...) routine
we never returned a non-nil error
we just logged it
and returned nil for error
so later we started returning a legit error if there was a problem compiling sass.
which failed the asset server, but it should be fine.
eh
@hari would know that better
the error you're describing (no generation of anything) doesn't seem like it would be affected by the fix me and Hari talked about
Hmm
there's no mw recipe
no
moovweb recipe
those are Naseem's, I usually let him know that we're bumping stuff and ask him to do a PR for it himself
googletv, foundation, etc..
scaffold...
jeff patzer does PRs
make changes in master
when its ready merge to deploy
and then update nosaka_build_scripts submodule
moovweb-operations repo
moovweb-operations/nosaka_build_scripts
submodules have no concept of a branch
it's just a hash
when you go into the submodule and you do a git pull origin deploy
you're basically just telling it to update the hash from whatever hash it has to the current hash for the remote deploy branch
eh
I was hoping we'd get rid of that
before updating the instructions, let's see where we land after the generator rework
there's an update.sh script in there
that does that for you
I can add that to the instructions
nope, should take like a minute
should be deployed
or rather
should be live
now
yep, that is the longest step
we
well*
I guess git clone might be the longest step

We still don't support SSLv3, but at least now we'll support TLS 1.0+
yes :p
@G3 after looking at the PR for absolutize and rewrite links I started wondering why these are separated into two functions to begin with
yeah
I guess
well
I was trying to think
as to why you'd ever want to absolutize URLs to begin with
what benefit that gives you.
I couldn't quite think of any, and neither could Sean
Well
if the path is relative, and we absolutize it, then we're proxying them anyways because we're absolutizing to the rewritten domain, right?
is that right, I'm not 100% sure
Hmm? when would the absolutize path not go through the proxy?
source_host is the proxy domain
yeah
If the base tag includes a different domain
yeah
Hmm
OK
not necessarily
The base tag could be a path as well
I believe
(without a domain)
which means the domain is still the same domain
but the path is altered
so relative link paths
get the base path prepended
Hmmm
Lemme talk to some people in CS to see what their conception of the function is
I'll get back to you with some more input.
kk
yeah
so looks like I was wrong
seems like source_Host is the origin site
and absolutize urls only adds that to images and scripts
which are things we don't want to proxy
yeah
OK
This makes more sense now.
Hmmm
So
It might be easier
Hmm
wait
ugh
ok
so
we have a meeting in 10
let's discuss that afterwards
I'm gonna grab a coffee before the meeting
canary tests run the mixers specific in the specific test
each test specifies which mixers to run against
it tests against all the mixers that have been released in apollo
if you don't have one in your .moovweb folder it downloads them
there's no default
the test will say that it needs mixer X version Y
and if you have it, it'll use it, if you don't, it'll download it
and then use it
running powermoov test inside canary-tests should be a decent marker for checking if there were regressions or not
how many tests did it run?  Should be close to a 1000
cool, and if everything passed, I think you should be pretty solid
@G3 are you around?
@G3 take a look at the Technical Services room, we discussed absolutize pretty thoroughly
Some key take-aways
people tend to edit absolutize_srcs a lot
it's very volatile, and prone to breaking things on occassion
hence why it might not be the best candidate to move to a mixer
however
rewrite_links seems to be pretty solid
and rarely requires patching
so that would be good to move to the mixer
however
it seems a more useful feature would be to have a function, kind of like rewrite_link, but for absolutize
in other words, to unrewrite it
or unrewrite and absolutize if you will
well
how it does it I'm not sure yet
but if it contains the host, it would unrewrite the host
and if it doesn't contain the host, it would add the origin host
(essentially what absolutize does)
I think, given how volatile some of these things are, what we want to put in our mixer would be the very simple straight forward unrewrite function (not set on the name yet, but we'll call it that for now)
no
I don't think so
given the conversations we had with the CS people
we can discuss it more with Sean
but I think
what I'd like to do is
create the simple helper, unrewrite
put that in the mixer
and then write *one* function in the generator
rewrite_links or whatever we want to call it
that does both rewriting of links as well as unrewritting the images and scripts when necessary
since it'll be all in one function
you don't have to do this global variable crazyness
so the code should be simpler
and since it's in the generator
it'll give people the flexibility to edit it
if they need to
don't make tests for absolutize srcs yet
let's discuss it with Sean first
you can work on tests for url stuff though if those are not in yet
Hmmm, ok
Hmm, I don't think it has to be as complicated as that
we have a rewrite_to_upstream function, we can leverage that.
It will take a proxy domain and rewrite it to it's appropriate origin domain
yeah
what was the easy changes?
Hmm, and what did you figure out was easier afterwards?
yeah
so
I should've talked to you about that project more before you guys got started
Sorry about not pointing you in the right direction
Next time just let me know what you're thinking of doing before you do it though, just to make sure we're all in the same page
and we don't have to waste time doing unnecessary work
That's good.
But yeah, so I closed the PR, since you know what the better change is, please go ahead and make that
and I'll evaluate that PR when that's ready
That's fine, but if you're pinged into a room, it's probably because someone needs you there.
Just go in there for the discussion, and leave it once it's done.
Ah
If it doesn't ping you if you're not in the room, then I would recommend not filtering out the email since that's the only notification you'll get
eh
No other repo should change
Steno should not need any changes
Only changes should be strictly in houston
if you need to make changes elsewhere
you're probably missing something
Anyways, there is an expectation that if someone pings you, regardless what chat room, you should go there, so please set up your notifications/email filters in such a way that you'll be alerted.
something must be weird
the only hipchat emails I get are when people @message me
https://moovweb.hipchat.com/account/notifications
You can customize the settings there
If you're in the office, there's less of an issue to ignore hipchat since we can communicate in person
but if you'll be working remotely, it is the only way to communicate, so we have to be responsive.
It's cool, new things are always heard
hard*
yeah
did it work?
hrmm
how about now?
just messaged you twice
Hmm
Hm, might have to wait for the changes to take effect
@all leaving for my doctor soon.  Will WFH as soon as that's over, no later than 4pm
@all I'm back

I'm alive
not kicking though
hey
oh
you're gone
sad
@SeanJ http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Snowflake
ooh
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_RDPUXEd0ykaScC81x-ItE08wYpAlNzO
lol
@all http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PL_RDPUXEd0ykaScC81x-ItE08wYpAlNzO
I can add that in there
link?
Currin has two entries
no reason why you can't either :p
Done
too bad :p
It's now forever recorded
FOREVER\n
tritium!
$("//*") { log(index()) }
oh no!
I MISSED THIS
HOW COULD I?!?!
no (rdcry)
Hmmmmmm
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
10 minutes?
woot (content)
(content)
woot woot!
cool
I'll add the stuff to the BB tomorrow/tonight
I started doing it
but was preempted by moving
for the new desks
wow
but it's not semantically the same, right?
the second xpath will match more
that the first….or is that not true?
I am
did someone break something?
I will have to have a talk with my pull requestees
oh shit
this is bad
if those links were in the generator
it means that there's probably some live projects out there
with those links
the cloudfront ones
which means we can't really take cloudfront down
unless we scrape all projects
and update those links
=(
indeed
sorry, just keep getting preempted with other stuff.
Anyways, gonna update the BB to rsync assets to both locations right now
CLI?
hahaha
hmm
question
if I use the rsync --delete flag
will that delete the project_assets folder?
(when syncing to the older location)
42 does not seem adequeate of an answer
: p
wow wow wow wow wow
Nope, rsyncing
sorry, thoguth I mentioned it yesterday
yeah
but the first command might delete project_assets
so that means the second would literary copy everything
well, actually, no, it's worse
becsause it would only copy this projects assets
and delete all other project assets
yeah
Hmm
can nginx/varnish have a fallback rule?
oh, yeah,
wait
this will work
yeah, I'm dumb, ignore me.
this should be fine
yeah, no worries
I'll hard code it for now
wait
no
I don't want to be interrupted
gah
page fault
phew
triple fault
lol
ok
should be easy enough.
question though
has the sync script been updated to sync both locations?
Yeah, I can do that.
and the cdn flush script?
that looks meaningless to me
sweet =D
ah
k, I'll look at them after lunch
@all going to lunch, will be back in an hour/hour+half
k, sound good
@JajaB are you done with your meeting?
does the PR look good?
cool
gonna merge in and do a test push
mdayaram/dashy
gonna add a new file on the root of the assets folder
pushing
yup
EVERYWHERE!
SWEET
nice
high five!
did it sync properly as well?
excellent
phase 1 complete
phase 2 is to update varnish to serve from the new location, right?
cool
should we disable git deploys while rsyncing?
true, just worried about rsync crazyness
true
k
they are indeed
I didn't figure them out for a while either
so useful
LOL
@JajaB if we had mass delete, I would get rid of them all
yeah, go head, I don't care
what I really wish is to be able to delete them from the apollo DB
those guys causes my home page to take FOREVER to load
: p
that would be nice
although
I ran those like
last year
I haven't needed to run gentest in over a year
I doubt we need them anymore
regardless, I use mdayaram as a non-serious test account anyways
nah
you're talking about the monit check?
that's different
it uses the moov-platform account
and it deletes the project after generating it
yep
well
there's a few that I use for constant testing
dashy
fancypants
definitely safe to delete anything that starts with projgentest though
but if you're asking me if I would ever miss anything under mdayaram, the answer is no : p
yeah
hence why I wish there was a mass delete option : p
SWEET
now…time to remove change in BB
this is the scurry part
eh
I think this might be a Go issue, not 100% sure
oh
that's something else
they're symlinks probably broke after upgrading
yeah, try to reinstall
yup
on it right now
I basically reverted the old change
and edited the config yaml file to include the new path
@JajaB looks good?
also
I just realized
in the confluence doc
but in the code, we were always uploading to /srv
was that just a discreptency?
ah
okie dokie
@JajaB http: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRfuAukYTKg&t=45s
wait, so he did that and it still didn't work? @nmakiya
eh, you could give it a try, not sure if it'll work or not if reinstalling didn't work
did you check if the files/symlinks are there and pointing to the right place?
@JajaB lol
@JajaB trying a new push to mdayaram/dashy
lemme know when you're ready
pushing
newer file
FINAL_NEW_FILE
oh
nooooo
shit
Hmm
that's right, we don't sync the path
shit…hmmm, so it's not as simple as just editing the config
adding a hotfix for now
@JajaB could we pass the full path to the sync script?
like
would that be ok?
Hmm
already fixed
I can undo
lol
nevermind
I didn't fix it
I fixed it in the branch : p
pushing
done
LAST_TIME
woots
so is there going to be a different sync script for the JS file then?
okie doke
actually
can the current sync script just sync both?
we pass it an account and project
it can sync both project assets and js stuff
so we only call the sync script once from the BB
Hmm
I guess that's true
fair enough
wooooo
sooo good
and things are still alive and kicking?
w00t
noaccess
stdlib 1.0.171 is broken
use stdlib 1.0.99
2.0.99
@SeanJ can we revert it in Tritium io?
stdlib has a bug in the URL related functions
Hmm
regression on url(…) function
I don't have access
nooo
nooo
the fix is in
but we haven't had a recent build of manhattan to build the new mixers with
because of a bug in gokogir
which I can try fix now
well, I've been trying, and failing : p
We can hide it for now
ok, it's hidden
The fix is merged in, but no new mixers have been built since then
did it?
what changed about it?
I thought that was in before 2.0.99
but I could be wrong I suppose
@all master branch of gokogiri is no longer for our internal build.  Use mw_master instead
if you use the ./nogo build script, this will automatically take care of things for you
2
@G3 no, just running the nogo script will do it
!!!!
<3
Me neither until I saw it
Glad you finally got it (content)
You're awesome, we just miss you <3
@G3 k, will review
lol
adrobs
adorbs*
YAY
hmm
2 minutes
I would say?
ok
well
apollo hasn't released the new route yet
and while testing it locally, it doesn't work for me
so I'm a little blocked on that
but I might just fake out a  good response from apollo to continue testing
depending on how many other things I Have to do
cool
cool
it works…did you copy that file manually?
oh
I'm assuming that's from the original dump/sync
cool
@G3 are the same PRs updated?
it was in manhattan and houston, right?
cool
@all stepping out to shower+lunch, ping me via an @noj or text message if you need me immediately
@all omg, crazy ride
sorry my lunch break was somewhat extended
had lunch at twitter, and then decided to work at their office a bit
Then moved to the Babson office and my batter ran out and I had to scrounge for a charger
I didn't =(
anyways
I am at a stable position now, with a power adapter and VPN capabilities
so I should be good until my doctors appointment
yup, in the middle of looking at them
@G3 made comments on houston
k
will look
@G3 rerebuttal
oh god
that reminds me
of a terrible song
a very nsfw song
yes
I have
that's the major nsfw part
@G3 have you seen my new comments?
rewriting?
Hmm, no need to wait for that
ah, I see, that other ticket
k
Hmm
There is one…or at least in the new mixers one such function has been added
hrmrmrm
we don't have any way to turn that off right now
you'd have to either regex it out
or finangle it somehow during parsing so that post parsing it doesn't have that new line
eh
probably easiest solution would be
inside html node
html() { remove("./div[ @class='has_whitespace' ]/text()") }
not sure if that works
but it's worth a try
I see
I wonder if it doesn't consider new lines as parts of text()...hmmm
hmm
I think it might reinsert as part of parsing
it kept the new lines that I inserted, even though I'm removing all text nodes
but it also inserted new newlines in certain key locations
prolly to follow html best practices (new lines between <head> and <body> and <meta> tags)
that's crazy
now I just don't know
anyways
I have to head out to my doctor's appointment
but it's definitely an issue with libxml
we can't do much about that other than regex, sorries =(
I got some code locally, but I couldn't test it because my local version of Apollo did not respond to the new route for js redirection
I wanted to wait for the code to get to stage to test it
It's weird, works fine for Mat locally but not for me.
So I'm dubious
On the ops side, josh has altered the cdn flush and sync scripts to work for the js redirection paths as well.
So we should be good on that front.
I should have something working by end of day today if the Apollo route works just fine.
There's the one that apache made
I think it's called apache bench
ab for short
lame
I thought it lets you do that, no?
looking at it right now
@G3 I added some more comments to Houston
minor stuff, mostly wording/comment related
Let me know when those are in and I'll merge everything in
@JajaB we can give it a try, not sure why it's disabled in the first place
well
yeah, not sure why
do you want to use SSL for all edgecast requests? that prolly makes sense
yeah
zhigang, always super descriptive with his commit messages
okie doke, I'll get to it when I get in today
also
the update/delete redirection scripts are done and in the BB, I'd like to test them out with you if you have time.
it calls ./redirect_sync in the cdn box
haha, I'll give you an hour, still have to get into the office :p
yes
did I break anything?
=/
we are running redirect_sync
is that not working?
probably redirect_Js/mdayaram/dashy.js
that's the one I've been playing with
I think the sync script isn't working :/
redirect_sync that is
oooooooooooooooooooooooh
ok
I will fix right now
fair enough
fixing
should be fixed now ^.^
just pushed the change, waiting for jenkins to propogate it, and then I'll run the sync script
yeah
works now
:p
it is a little slow
not the mother land!
yay
Yay
@aj add some test cases and then go ahead and merge it in.  I unfortunately don't have enough time to properly review it, but it's self contained enough that it should be ok
@all Leaving at 5pm today because I was too silly to pack yesterday.
@SeanJ are we doing sprint planning?
Happy birthday @Aaron from Guatemala!
Going great!
pretty awesome
terrified of my inbox
I looked at it today
300+ new emails
Gonna take a day to just sort it all out
ha
MY console page?
no
which one? mdayaram, or noj?
lemme see here
LOL
omg
I was gonna write a selenium script to do it :p
Ahhhh
COOL
does apollo stage talk to it?
YES
omg
@JajaB NICE, the BUILD_ENV is set where though?
@G3 lol, when I come back :p
oh, nice
omg
that's awesome
=D
(content)
that's totally worth all the 300 emails I'll have to sift through when I get back.
omg, that makes me so happy
Are giedi stage and slug stage repopulated every day with copies of production?
lol
so what you're saying is that the more vacations I take, the more shit will get done?
I'm sold.
cool
what?
NOooooo!
but I worked so hard!
I spend ALL OF MONDAY setting it up
(rdcry)
hahaha
I think future noj deserves a desk
work from a random cave in the middle of the guatemalan jungle to reach nirvanoj
one thing I wanted to do this trip which I didn't get a chance to do was sit underneath a waterfall
I did get to jump off a 30 foot cliff into a river though, that was pretty cool =D
terrifying, but cool
Anyways, gotta head out
I'll see you guys Monday!
well, everyone except Jaja :p
Take care @all!
lol, you should ask @cneale to help
the nojment will be spread!
alrighty, laters!
yay!
(content) aww, I missed you guys too.
Next time we should all go to Belize!
actually
the second @foo = 2 simply overrides the first @foo = 1
so
when you call test?
So
@foo = 1 is initialized at the class level
when you call the new method
it gets overriden
with 2
if you call teh blah method before calling new
:p
hm
so it doesn't get overriden
well
they're technically not hte same variables
one is tied to the class
yeah
yeah, but when you do A.class_eval { @foo } you'll get 1 instead of 2
and that's just because initialize hasn't been called yet
yeah
It's the same variable, just get's overwritten when we call new
and when you call self.class.blah
you're access @foo of a different instance that hasn't been initialized
it affects
@@foo and @foo are different variables
@@foo will be tied to the class, @foo is tied to the instance
@JajaB that's weird
@superkev yeah, that's because class variables are persistent for the lifetime of a program
Ah
does ruby have a singleton class for every class?
oh
yeah, that's the class object
not an instance
so a @@var is always a variable to the singleton class object
But not sure why declaring @var at the class level doesn't let you access it as a normal instance var
that part is weird
well
@var shouldn't be
eh
not sure about @var being declared at class level, but @@var vs @var should definitely be class var vs instance var
@JajaB you around?
halp >>
L<<
<>
yay
so
this is a place that we used to read/write from in the production buildbox
was wondering if you could give us perms
Hmmmmm
I wonder who >.>
lemme know when it's all good ^.^
is everything going ok?
@JajaB ?
<3
so much loves
(flutteryay)
kinda
slug is in the right play (yey)
but
mps is not reading it
for whatever reason
place*
but reddit project wroks
ooh
that's weird
year
we saw the file there
well
the first one is there
if you look in the box
not sure why nginx can't find it
ooooooooh
trying it
OK
yey
works now
looks like we broke the syncing
will have to fix that
but other than that
sweetness
we might as you to deploy a new set of scripts to the staging
with the syncing fixed
thankee!
@all stepping out for the doctor's now
should be in the office post-lunch, prolly a little after 1pm
haha, yeah
@JajaB you around?
wow
doubles?
I literary forgot what I wanted to ask you
oh wait, I remember now
nvm
I'll just....look into it :p
we need to get a better microphone for dogpatch
hearing anything in that meeting was rather difficult
yeahj
oh
gross
hrmrmrm
Can anyone tell me the IP address of peabody?
@SeanJ the example you gave in the edgecast ticket is supposed to return 200
you should've linked your test
oh snap
also
it's returning 404 for me now
weeeeird
they must've "fixed" it?
fyi, @all I made this app a while ago to debug some issues we were having, through I'd share:  http://dechor.herokuapp.com/
What does it do you ask?
let's you dictate the server what kind of response you want
curl -i http://dechor.herokuapp.com/200
or
curl -i http://dechor.herokuapp.com/418
You can also pass response headers as URL parameters
curl -i 'http://dechor.herokuapp.com/418?Coffee=NO'
It's public, submit a PR :p  https://github.com/mdayaram/dechor
BTW
I also have headerecho.herokuapp.com
if any of you haven't seen that one, it's much older
but it basically responds back with the request it was requested with
(as the response body)
it should never fail!
yep yep (fuckyeah)
I do admit I should write better README's for both of them
everything I do needs a better README
I fail at reading myself
interesting
new mouse time
@aj did you end up using the context map to add information from the slug manager to it?
oh? I thought your nickname in hipchat was @pizza
what was it?
yes
yeah
yeah
I would stick with pizza
it's a commodity
hahahaha
anyways, yeah, @pizza, I'd like to see your changes, they'll help me out with logging
wait, I'm confused
how does jaja know about the PR 0.o
good enough for me
I think Omar had made a style guide a while back
but other than that, I don't know
neat
ok, I'm gonna eat some breakfast, brb
@pizza lemme know when the PR is ready for review
okie dokes
hey, did you guys get my invite?
oh, I bet all of you are at lunch
lame
lunchies
excellent
white elephant gift exchange
calendar invite
did it have the description on it?
I'm wondering whether I should send an email about it or if the invite is enough
doesn't have to be good
could be complete crap
that's the beauty of white elephants
no one cares!
no
k, cool, thanks
I
fucking
hate
github PR diffs
as a code review tool
adskfsafasdgas
god dammit
just cause a line of code is not part of a diff doesn't mean I shouldn't be allowed to comment on it
fucking A
aararaargh
stupid fucking diffs and your stupid fucking collapse view,adsfsdfsdf
brb, gonna take a razor blade bath.
hmm
@pizza are you available?
@hcatlin so I guess what we can do is set a header in the response that tells varnish that this request was a page view
and then varnish can log that info into the billing data
that's gonna really kill us on ajax heavy sites though
what about html_fragment, do you want that to count?
right
at a per-request basis
So, I can do the MPS side, but @JajaB should be made aware of this change.
as you said, we want to hide the header from the user, so we'll want varnish to remove it?
oooh
tell the other meeting goers I said hi (content)
anyways, I'll talk to him and figure it out
we can chat more about it tomorrow need be
yeah
I'm making a bunch of logging/header changes today
so they'll be in there
please don't scare the bejezus out of me like that though…I thought something terrible had happened when you called >.>
it's ok, I still love you :p
http://www.watchcartoononline.com/thumbs/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Is-Magic-Episode-9.jpg
hey
I wanted to do the review of your PR using video chat or something
because github PRs suck
and they make me want to kill myself
ok
@pizza did you tell the apollo folks about the new routing requirements?
er
manifest requirements?
dammit, stop being everywhere at once :p
cool
ok
I made a bunch of test pivotal stories as Sean suggested
:p
If we can get a staging build of apollo
lol
I made mine as chores
(for testing)
hmm
I added 5.0.slugid
didn't add the routing
I added routing to one of them
nah, a non-test one
MPS should consume updates from existing slugs
that one
lol
bais
ok, I'm going to make a checklist of things to check
@pizza latest windows build failed, looks like it might be related to your changes?
@MichaelCatlin wait, huh?
oh
so when the project is running
and you browse to www.site.com
it goes to your local instance
and you'd have to stop the project from running
to view the live one
not the prettiest
but if you have the toolkit
it should tell you that the site you're viewing is a local project
not sure =/
@pizza cool
generator
will resolve the IP
and generator a config.json
that has the IP on the right hand side
the SDK will not do auto-resolving
so
if you push with IPs
things will work
still
it's just not ideal
cause the IPs could change
If we want to add a warning, there's no story for that
I can make one, but I'll put it in the icebox
I don't think it's something we should worry about for the next week or two anyways
ooh
I wanted to work with you on those
are they done?
ok, will look at it again once I'm done doing the logging stuff
waaa
I can't run mps locally anymore
waa
@pizza
(rdcry)
I wanna run/test mps locally
but I get a nil pointer exception when I curl it
howtofix? aka, what new things do I need to set up to run it?
@pizza you said you added a change for error checking in mps? I don't see any new commits from you, are you sure you pushed to master?
ah, is it updated?
I should probably add a bit as to why we're considering removing it...hrmrmrm
ok
@hari do core-rewriter tests pass? no failures are expected.
@Aaron lol, yeah, that would be pretty sweet
eeh
wait
let's wait until all tests are passing
before adding your change
must fix current broken tests before adding new tests
I thought you said that test was new?
so it just started failing all of a sudden? that's really weird
ok, so it's different from before.  yeah, regardless, before we make a framework wide change to fix something that is not preexisting yet, let's fix the things that regressed first
wait, why are we talking about skipping tests?
that's fine
it's the only test failing in stdlib
it's fairly isolated, we can deal with that later
core-rewriter is in pain though
not sure why
I'm trying to run it now...
@pizza -rw-rw-r--    1 slug slug 5430455 Dec 14 00:36 routing_manifest.json
@JajaB online?
Hmmm, I believe we decided that you should use capture in those cases
capture will prevent that from happening
do you have to use replace?
if you HAVE to use replace
then you could do something like this:
replace(...) {\n  $saved_1 = $1\n  $saved_2 = $2\n  // do stuff\n  $1 = $saved_1\n  $2 = $saved_2\n}
yup, np
@superkev if i have a bug I need to file against the generator, what bucket in pivotal do I do that in?
K, THANKS
woops
caps lock
@G3 latest scripts are in staging
but git push isn't working
I gotta help Sean with something, check it out and see if you can figure out what's wrong
I'm getting this error:
ooh
so
conditions:
1) rehosted
2) moov deploy
so
I just updated the staging scripts
like 10 minutes ago =/
so things will be different
hrmrmrmrm
lemme see
cool
thankee
are you WFH today?
nvm
just saw your email
@JajaB anything specific you'd like me to cover with the interviewee?
as in, anything you wish you could've covered but didn't have enough time for
eh
that message wasn't not sent out to the people in charge of changing that error message :p
@G3 is helping I'm assuming?
@hari I believe it was related to permissions errors with user's ssh keys
@G3 @superkev can you answer hari's question?
phew
ok, just needed time to refresh
indeed, it would be cool if we could have an indicator in apollo
Happy new year!
so
@MatB for now we should update all the stuff in staging to do a final validation on the SDK, right?
I'll do the same with the build scripts as well as a the manhattan gem
ok
@MatB BB and manhattan gem in BB are all updated to the latest
how's apollo
?
I also believe Josh fixed the version issue
cool
Yeah, i want to make more precise repro steps for that
before I file a pivotal issue
yeah
there's a few isues
one is
It's not clear what I should input in the terminal for deploying
like
which domain should I use? that's unclear
the other is the confusion that takes place when you change that domain
and how to handle that
whether it's a technical issue, or a UX issue, or both, we need to handle it somehow….
I guess it's not super critical, it can most likely wait until later
but something to keep in mind, aka, have a pivotal thing to track it
@all cl02 and the BB are both running 4.9.51 (the latest) -- likewise, apollo and the build scripts are updated to the latest
Please test the shit out of things =)
@SeanJ you said you wanted to chat? lemme know when you want to do that
um
Hmm
I frogot too
eh, those are on the works…it was something else
or rather
I believe Hari is testing in Linux
and I'll try to repro those steps in windows
but I thought it was something else
right
yeah
I feel pretty good about the MPS release
the SDK not too sure about
so
gems are broken right now
that is
moov service definitely does not work
if you use gems
so yeah, it's something we need to decide if we want to make the effort to make them work
config.json…sounds like Mat and Hcat got that then.
or wait, are you saying hampton is looking at it, or we should get hampton to look at it?
oh right
transitioning that feature to apollo control
right
so
I know of one suggestion, but we should definitely discuss
But for now, it's probably best to leave it as is?
It is somewhat confusing at first
but it's not a deal breaker
prolly best to get everything else solid
and then add better management of that later?
post 5.0
no worries
yeah
well
even then
you need the moovweb domain there
yep yep
@SeanJ where can I find a link to the page that has everyone's projects that they're using for testing on?
thankee
cool
checkout flow as well?
shotty sanrio
cool
right
that's fine
I'm going to purchase my own sanrio things
I see it has an updated billing address
nice
yes
lemme update that doc
which by the way
confluence is a terrible tool for collaborating with a constantly updating doc
everytime I click save I fear I deleted someone's work
oh yeah
I remember an issue with hacker news and https
I don't understand how we're supposed to test single domain with existing projects
It can only be rehosted
appy
that's gonna use 4.7
oh, I see what you're saying
did you do sudo moov deploy?
no
you shouldn't
but if you did, that might've caused some issues
Can we download the zip that was uploaded and inspecct the contents?
@G3 @MatB what's the best way to do that?
neat
@MichaelCatlin prod or staging?
4.7.77
oh
I think nature is a compass project?
ah, cool
should we test checkout both locally and in staging?
k
yup
depends
did it happen once?
or all the time?
ugh
fucking hacker news
I swear to god, their site is the jankiest thing on the web
I have no idea, that should not happen, but I'm also not surprised that it happens with hacker news
why?
oh yeah
maybe just test checkout locally?
I'll update the doc
@MichaelCatlin yeah do checkouts locally
also, that's not good
so
this is the second time it's happened
where
config.json didn't have the site
and it let me push
but then it's an error in the cloud
makes manoj sad
(rdcry)
why we no error on hostname validate?
Hmm
the problem was that
my config.json didn't include my moovweb domain
looks like a real failure
I filed a github issue for it, it's a test failure for a new feature that we don't use, so it should be ok, going to ignore the test for now.
next build should be fine
eh
I can't imagine it going longer than 5 minutes
so yes, something is weird
weird
was gonna say…that's really cheap
@MatB can we do that tomorrow? I'm still not done with the project stuff, keep getting preempted
@G3 hmm, looks like it's stuck or something...
sigh
I don't know why jenkins is being weird
@G3 please escalate to ops
I don't have SSH access from home, so I can't really check much
yes
eh
I imagine it should be pretty easy…the hard part is keeping it in sync with production
that migration would take forever
but I guess we can just run rsync nightly
I'll leave that up to ops, whether they'd want to do that or not
weird
the checkout result page in sanrio is unstyled
but everything else was totally fine
weird
I refreshed, now it's styled...
weird...
looks like it's their fault
Try using a normal User Agent
I bet they're returning 400 if the User Agent isn't a known browser
ok
sorry, not sure what you mean?
the host header should not be rewritten if you're using the core mixer
Hmm, well, if you're using the latest version and it's doing that, then it's a bug
But the latest released version should be fine
what version was that?
hmm….I'm looking at the code, give me a bit.  could be an issue in the proxy
k
well
I don't think there were any major changes done to it, but just for consistency, let's deploy the latest built.
I'm deploying 0.1.121
@SeanJ core 0.1.121 is deployed
Sean, what version did you release again?
oh
can you do that in staging apollo?
cool
ok, yeah, this is a regression
that's odd
we have mixer tests for this
but they're passing in jenkins....
must be a discreptancy...
eh
I update the mixer
and the config.json
oh
ok
hmm
k
did you update the Mixer.lock file to use the core mixer instead of whatever was there?
yeah
also
@SeanJ I'm getting some weird behavior on pajamagram
if I run perfect proxy on it (using single domain configs), everything looks fine
but if I try to run the current mobile site
it changes some image sources (not all, just some) into their IP address equivalents
Makes me think it might be project specific
k
oh
I noticed a pattern
it only happens to images that are being late loaded
as in
images that have the URL on the data-url attribute as well
gonna leave it as a proj specific thing.
but I'll take note of it on the doc
@MatB let me know when you want to test BB/Apollo
sure, I can do that
cool
just to be clear, we're talking about this checklist, right?
The second section, right?
right
cool
ok
so
yesterday
during the exisitng project testing
ah
ok
yeah, hopefully monday
so
let's see
I tested 4.9 yesterday for a bunch of these things
lemme go through it and check real quick
nevermind
I only got to check three boxes :p
ok
let's walk down the line
starting with the legacy/rollback list
you said you did a git push, right?
cool
the zip file you mean?
shit
I don't have ssh access
from home
hmm
let me ask Jaja how hard would it be to add me.
hold on
OK
I has the SSH!
@MatB I don't see the zip file for 55128
hmm
only if it's  a git push
Hmm
hrmrmrmrmrm
can you try again?
what project?
Hmm
do you have Debug output on?
Debug output should tell you the result of the zip file, do you see any errors?
interesting
I see it now
I was looking in the wrong directory
>.>
yup, totally there
@MatB why aren't you doing yoga?
ook, I would've been fine with testing this later, but up to you
ok, I'm going to check for the duplication of the assets
cl22.moovdns.net
what's the site id and endpoint id?
yeah, that exists
looks good
oh yeah
forgot about that page
yup, all those are in there
I did a diff on the main.js file for default endpoint and matb/hannaanderson-sing
single
and they're the same
that looks good
cool
under matb?
I think so
although
I don't see it in the cdn folder
just called hannanderson?
oh
I thought you said you generated a different one?
k
checking
yup
yup
ws this generated via console UI or command line?
cool, ok, so all of that's checked off
sounds good, looks like the only things left are moov generate command line and js redirection
oh, true
@MatB FYI, one of my friends is doing a study on TDD and BDD.  I was helping him out with how we use those here at Moovweb, but at the end of the day, I told him you might be better suited to answer his questions, so I gave him your email, I hope that's ok. \nIf it's not, just tell him that you actually have no idea who I am, and to stop taking advice from crazy people :p
I told him we do a lot of testing (on apollo) but we don't necessarily adhere to strict TDD or BDD
or rather, we never really label them as such
we just label them as testing
also
I was gonna test command line generate while you were gone
but the generate command doesn't exist in the latest sdk
and after a bunch of random failed hacks that didn't work, I've decided to build 4.7 to point against staging
yeah, that might be hard
i can copy a zip file from prod and put it in stage
lemme finish checking generate first
command line generate that is
ok
generated project fails
from moov generate
slug is not executable
if you follow normal directions
@MatB it has to do with the domain list that's generated
so
it looks like apollo adds more domains to the domain list than exist in the config.json
My config json when generating a project:
{\n	"host_map": [\n		"$.heychickadee.com => www.heychickadee.com",\n		"$.heychickadee.com => heychickadee.com"\n	]\n}
domain list in project settings: mmdayaram11909.www.heychickadee.com	 Configure\nmmdayaram11909.heychickadee.com
Right
so the problem here is
Because mmdayaram11909.www.heychickadee.com	is in apollo
MPS will respond to it
and find the proper slug for it
but because mmdayaram11909.www.heychickadee.com	is not in the config.json
it can't run that slug
why does apollo need to generate that extra domain?
why can't it use the other one as the moovweb domain?
ooooh, is it because when I generated, the starting domain was www.heychickadee.com?
right…I see
ok
yeah, it probably won't be for a while
but
this problem is not for single domain only
this is a normal rehosted project
experiencing this
so
from what I can tell
I did
SCREAM
:p
moov generate should automatically have it there!
so
right, but people will still be running 4.7 generate
after we upgrade all the things
so
this is what I understand is happening:
I ran moov generate stuff www.heychickadee.com
from this, apollo discerns that the moovweb domain will be hostvar.www.heychickadee.com
and then kicks off teh generate scripts
the generate scripts call site analyzer, and the default ruleset is to strip the WWW from the domain, leaving me with this:
{\n	"host_map": [\n		"$.heychickadee.com => www.heychickadee.com",\n		"$.heychickadee.com => heychickadee.com"\n	]\n}
Thus, moovweb domain is no longer in rules
we could, but that could also change
yeah
sigh
I'm not sure what to do about this..
I could change the old generator
to include a rule for www domains
but the whole point we original stripped it is because we thought that was silly and we should remove it
yeah
maybe run it by hcat?  I think the easier thing to do would be to update the generator to include a rule for www
but it just makes things look slightly uglier
I don't know
k
Hmm
Actually
we could also force people to upgrade to 5.0 once that's out?
like
disable the old style generate
in apollo, if that route gets hit, just return back a NO
or something like that
no
old-style generate is still hititng apollo
we can't change that
it's on existing SDK's
true, but in 5.0?
Some SDK's will output error message, but things older than 4.2 I don't think will.
right
yeah, prolly not
and we can always add a help page about it
can you run it by hampton real quick to make sure this is ok (aka, we don't have to worry about the problem because we'll just disable the old generate pretty soon)
is he in the office?
k
andrew….?
weird
only andrew I knew is farmer, the old employee
oh man, maybe he's coming back
>.>
::gossip::
yar, Hampton is talking to "Andrew"
but "Andrew" who?
for the .css rule
is that the .css directory, or file extension?
we should make sure it's the directory
k
k
k
some go tests would be great for the archive module in general
@pizza can you work together with Greg to write test cases for the archive stuff
golang test cases
(is amit in the office?)
cool, thanks
@MatB I'm gonna make some food.  When Hampton gets back, can you ask him about our plan regarding old generate?
@SeanJ when do you want me to start branching today?
If they need to make commits to any repo, I'd rather wait until they're done…or if they're willing to wait until I'm done.
deploy looks ok
@G3 and @pizza how are the tests coming along?
ok
as long as those tests are in and running/passing by EOD today, we can branch tonight then
do they know enough about it to write a test plan?
ok
so then it's fine for now then
yeah
I think that will fix a lot of problems
because you expect to be able to deploy to the domain of the site you view
but that doesn't work
and then
you expect to be able to view the site you're deploying to
but that also doesn't work
those are the two inconsistencies
@MatB I tried rebuilding with zip and no upload
and it failed =(
nvm
I found out why
the mixer is not released in staging
looks good
ok, all that's left is js redirection
@MatB I finished the testing
it all looks good
high five
what changes?
oooh
I guess I misunderstood what you said earlier
so what he wants is that we don't automatically add the moovweb domain to the host map?
gotcha
can we get those changes in staging today?
k
cool
brb, going to the drug store real quick
back
cool
nice
sounds good
let's leave it at that for now
hopefully I'll be good enough to come in monday
no worries
glad we're getting there ^.^
thankee
@pizza @G3 how are the tests coming along
?
@pizza @G3 a build just finished, 63, does that have the latest fixes for moov deploy plus tests?
hmm
@hari @hcatlin did you guys finish the changes you were making for the mac packaging?
was going to branch tonight
yeah
just wanted to make sure everything is stable
ok, cool
Just need the OK from @pizza and @G3
Do you know where they are? Both are being unresponsive
ah, cool
@pizza are you working with @G3 for the tests?
ok, cool
ok
Make sure you guys discuss the different kinds of test cases that are necessary
you'll need the same set of test cases for both tar and zip
PR is fine
ok, let's wait for the tests
once those go in, I'll branch
sounds good
@pizza @G3 are you guys still working on the tests?
eta?
ok
just wanted to make sure I was around when it was done
I might go AFK for a bit
eh
you can't
you'd have to put a file in it
why do you need an empty dir?
eh
oh
you want to test zipping an empty directory?
create it during the test
golang has a tempdir helper
which will give you randomly generated temporary directory
and you can use that
no good?
I see
Hmm
Hrmrmmrm
yeah, that does kind of suck a bit…but it's the only way I can think of =/
beep boop
how's the progress? @pizza @G3
cool
you guys still in the office?
lol
much appreciated
though I would like to remind you guys that it's OK to say that something will take too long and will have to wait until tomorrow
er, monday
I appreciate you guys staying late, but please don't feel pressured to.
work/life balance for the wins!
or something like that
I dunno
two back? did something break?
=/
if the zip hard is too much trouble to get to tonight, that's fine
you guys can work on it on monday
but go ahead and commit the tar tests
that's weird
hmmm, so what you're saying is that there was a bug in the tar code that your tests are exposing?
sure
right
oh
oh, yeah, that makes sense
the test will have to tar, then untar, and diff the result of the untar vs the original
same goes with the zips
I see
well
like I said, you guys can wait until monday, it's ok :p
did you order dinner by the way?
you know you're allowed to expense dinner if you're staying late
=(
You can do that now
>>
well
at least raid the kitche
kitchen
*
okie dokie
continuing monday?
that's fine
I'll go ahead and branch tonight anyways
eh?
oh, right, well, yeah, that's the point :p
tests are not to prove something is working (although that's helpful).   Tests are to be made aware that something broke in the future
no
You can trust that things are working now
but a change in the future might inadvertently break this functionality
without you noticing
that's why we have tests
Yes, that is one of it's uses…they have several.
eh, fair enough, guys, go home :p
:p
sounds good
yup yup
later
@MatB ya ready?
hmm, hold on
have to tend to something
sorries, false alarm :p
cool, let's get started in 15, have to help someone else with something
@pizza @G3 how's the testing going?
@pizza what are you working on in the mean time?
:p
@G3 how close are you to done?
with the comparison stuff that is
K
@pizza can you review Greg's changes once they're done?
Do the whole PR/comments/patches shebang
cool
Apollo release took precedence, will work on it after lunch.  For now feel free to comment the C code in xml/text.go to make things work locally
Yeah, if either of them is in the office, please bring it to their attention
Alternatively, you can turn the tests off and tell them in the morning
cool
what was the issue?
ah
fun stuff
@all heading out, will probably work from home after doctors
bai
@all I'm back
oh
yeah….did we not remove Git from the installer?
@TarunDesikan did it ask you or did it have it as an installer option?
aka, was it just a message saying "You should download git now!" or did it have a checkbox for git installation?
ok, can you make a pivotal for me to remove that?
I see…ok, thanks
ya
yeah
hrmrm
so
prolly will spend the next couple of hours verifying that the rollout is ok
for moov deploy...
hrmrmrm
I don't know
what I wanted to verify was that the build scripts are definitely not being called
right now it looks like they're not
but we can't be sure
in order to do that
I added a bunch of debug statements in the scripts
that write to a file
and I was gonna check if that file ever gets written
but after I tried those changes in staging, it broke the scripts
so I have to figure out why they broke
do you have repo access to the build scripts?
cool
if you wanna mess around/fix that
that would be great ^.^
does that seem reasonable?
I'll send out an email with a summary as well
ah, fuck, you even sent out an email
didn't see that until now
dammit
oh, yeah
added
@SeanJ do you have any more follow up items you'd like to add?
I did
I already told her it's fixed.
Do you want me to add her to the RCA?
(by add, I mean @ mention her name in it)
yeah
one sec
ok
so
right
so I was looking at the code
noticed that that chunk of the code has not changed since I introduced the http_proxy support
which was in October
So I figured it might be related to the go upgrade
so compiled latest master with Go1.2 to verify that the problem still exists, then compiled with go1.1 and the problem was gone
I took a look at the cert
from scholastic
it seems legit
in fact
their cert is 100% legit
they don't need that domain in the ssl white list
they just did that in the project because that's what our instructions said to do
in order to fix it
anyways
that's a clear Go regression
so I filed that bug
Right
So in the proxy level
No, they never had it there
Yesterday they noticed that the site stopped working
with this error:
Because of that error
they added the domain to the whitelist
however, that error was incorrect
If you notice at the bottom
it says "local error:  bad record MAC"
That's a completely different issue
If it was an SSL whitelist error, it would say something along the lines of....
hostname doesn't match expected hostname
or something like that
right
well
no
on the Handshake
no
it didn't
because
adding a domain to the SSL whitelist stops us from verifying the hostname
but it never got to that step
because it fails at the Handshake
TLS 1.0
nope
Because it worked on Go1.1
We can compile using Go1.1
and that should work
instead of 1.2
we can't use 1.0.3
because a lot of our code now depends on libraries that are introduced in go1.1
yeah, I was able to compile using go1.1 and the issue was resolved
what do you mean?
Yes, this is true
oh yeah
CLOSE_WAIT connections
Yeah
Hrmrmrmrmrmm
neither are appealing.
For short term...as in *this* release
I would take go1.0.3 and add the libraries that we're missing from 1.2
make our own fork of that monster
Wel
well
I wanted to investigated the diffs of the commits in go
to see exactly how this was introduced
I know where the error is coming from
it's an if statement that compares the localMAC vs the remoteMAC
and for some reason
for this cert
they don't match
I could easily remove that if statement
but who knows what insecurities I'd introduce by doing that
yes
exactly
ok, sounds good
@hari are you done with the windows installer changes?
need to remove the git installer, want to make sure we don't step over eachother's toes
that's fine, same
also
even with the new db dump
bundle exec rake db:migrate fails for me
woe is me
solution:
drop database apollo_development;
create database apollo_development;
load latest dump
fixed =)
no
that would be an exploit :p
why do you ask?
eh, tell him the only way to skip it is by sending a request with the cookie set
@MatB is there a way I can get a dump of all the upstream domains we have?
Watching Jessica's talk, let's do it after
@MatB the code is in staging
could you verify the redirect stuff yourself,
I have to deal with a production issue
ok, Sean took over the prod issue
I can help out now
is apollo up to date in staging?
@MatB ?
k
k
hm
did you wait long enough after the first update?
it's possible that their cache timeouts were out of sync
TOGETHER! (yey)
Cool, I'll look into it when I get in the office
roughly 5 or so
I'm composing the data now
I don't know which are production and which aren't, but I'll send you a list pretty soon
Here are the domains affected by the SSL issue:
\nfhbonline.fhb.com\nwww6.rentacenter.com\nclubs2qa.scholastic.com\nclubs2stg.scholastic.com
Yes
unnecessary
Add the setting to their config.json now
current sdk ignores settings it doesn't know
Hmm
wait
we can add it to the routing manifest
And have MPS retrieve that info from there
new MPS will get info from routing manifest
and do the right thing
setting can live in apollo I guess, or for consistency, in config.json and then uploaded to apollo on a push
er
deploy
if we put it on a slug
then there could be down time
unless
we upgrade the SDK in the build box before MPS
If you want to do that
we can put it in the slug
right
Hmm
if we're betting that 4.7 will play nice with these slugs, there's no reason to not upgrade the BB and just leave it upgraded
we run the same risk either way
and we can't prevent other individuals from pushing during that time.
oooh
fancy
scurry, but fancy
right
well, before I can add the feature
I'll need to know where to fetch it from.  Are we sure it'll be in the slug and not the manifest?
oh yeah
@SeanJ alternatively, we could compile the slugs locally, and have Jaja copy them over to prod
ok
k
Here's this if you want:
Rows highlighted red are failures
It's all except these:
I could not get the upstream for those domains
because apollo has corrupted data for them.
@SeanJ new idea
what if
if you have ssl_verify set to false
we also assume you want this setting
of max tls version 1.0
that way the slug stays the same
everyone can push the config on the projects now, 4.7 slugs are updated with the info
and the new MPS will do the right thing
what do you think?
sorry, I meant ssl_whitelist
right, so it's fine
yar
TLS 1.0 is the maximum we used to support before anyways
the setting doesn't enforce tls1.0, it enforces a maximum of tls1.0
I can run the test again with that setting on all upstream
and see if there are any differences
right
so
two of the affected domains are staging only
the only two prod ones are these, right?
fhbonline.fhb.com\nwww6.rentacenter.com
right, but for them it's only their staging server
so I figured it's ok to have them use ssl_whitelist
in fact, they're already doing htat
that*
hmm, lemme chec
check
thanks
cool, thanks
@SeanJ since we're doing the config, do you still want MPS to log whether a request used that config?
It's probably easier to log that info in the BB than in MPS, the BB could also push that info to Apollo
@SeanJ logging question above?
@SeanJ please advise on who should review my PR for the new config
lol
yeah, this is probably good enough
(by this, I mean platform room notification as opposed to email)
The fix involves an apollo and BB deploy
The current BB and apollo staging version have been tested and are solid to go
we'd be deploying those versions to prod
hmm
I have a dinner to attend at 6, so I won't be around
sigh, pushed yet another day :p
well
it's a project setting
well
we don't currently log ssl_whitelist stuff
and this is along the same lines as that
but you can find that info in the project
ok, currently I'm not logging it.
ok
@pizza do you have time to review a PR regarding SSL?
er, TLS
woots
@pizza let me know if you have any questions
also
random trick I learned
if you're looking at diffs
and you're frustrated for all the formatting/whitespace diffs
add the parameter "w=false" to the github URL
and it'll only show you non-whitespace diffs
mad useful
@Aaron gosass-testing is failing
@MichaelCatlin I'm not sure what you're talking about? I know Jeff sent out a doc for Moovweb5 not long ago
@MatB we've decided to do something simpler which won't require us to do anything fancy, just add a patch to MPS that will allow the change to be seamless
yay
@pizza moar ssl reviews!
right, so
I didn't completely undo all changes
I left the changes that updated the interface in mirrorhttp
and the changes in houston and whatnot were just to fit the new interface
don't want to
I like this interface better
it's more flexible
yup
yayay
@pizza before you look into the dashboard code, take a look at Jenkins, the packaging job is failing'
true story, almost had a heart attack just now
(truestory)
I was testing the rollout by starting with the test cluster
and I was browsing m.kay.com
and the search page looked terrible
but I looked at their prod site and it looked fine
so I freaked out
but then I realized
that the stage server is now hooked up to staging git and staging build box and staging slug server
not that many people replied
I was hoping for more
@m @pizza @Aaron @G3 we're starting!
We're going to start with Cluster 22 (test cluster)
The IP address is 54.193.32.26
Here is the spreadsheet to log your results:
Set your /etc/hosts to the IP address for the domain you're assigned to
yeah
There's the column
"Features Reviewed"
those are the features you want to check for
when checking your project
You may go ahead and get started
You are checking for anything that looks odd
These are production projects, so they should look like pretty solid mobile websites
if anything is amiss
like something that's supposed to be clickable isn't doing anything
login is broken, things look out of wack, it's a bad sign and yell really really loudly.
?
@JajaB did you sync the routing_manifest as well?
that should be fine.
hrmrmrmrm
Hmm
is there a way that we can make CL22 MPS just point to the production slug server temporarily?
that way we won't have to worry about making sure apollo, cdn, and all the thigns are like prod
cool
Yeah, I think that's probably a good idea
cl02 = deving integration testing
cl22 = production rollout testing
yeah
makes sense that way
@JajaB OK, I believe we're ready for staging cluster upgrade!
5.0.39 plz
yup
@pizza @m @Aaron @G3 new IP for CL03: 184.72.40.125
The upgrade needs to propagate
I'll announce when we're ready to test
cool, thanks
@pizza @m @Aaron @G3 cluster is upgraded! begin testing!
@JajaB we're looking good at CL03
Can we go ahead and upgrade community?
and then we'll call it a day/weekend
no worries
Just to make sure, community cluster is CL50, correct?
And its IP address is 54.208.48.21 ? (want to make sure there's no crazy load balancing things I should worry about )
ah, ok
@pizza @m @G3 @Aaron For the community container, there are two clusters involved, CL50 and CL51
We'll split the testing on the two
Cool
Those are the IP address
Me and @m will take CL50
@pizza @Aaron and @G3 take CL51
Yup yup, hold off on testing until Jaja is ready
cool! thankee!
LOL
that is pretty epic
"Oh? Is that a birthday cake?"
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE GROUND!"
@JajaB Thanks for the help!  We're all good!
how are the logs looking?
^.^
yay
lol
I see a bunch of requests coming in for webby.hazasite.com
is that our highest trafficked site in our community cluster? :p
noice
Gonna make a dashboard for clusters 50 and 51 in graphite just to gauge how they're doing
LOL
sweet
@m @Aaron @G3 @pizza Thanks everyone for helping with the rollout!
yes, it should
though is there a reason why you're not using the latest?
me, @cneale and @MatB are gonna work on deploy
Generate and dashboard, we have to decide what we want to do for 5.0 and what we want to save for 5.1
There's too many awesome ideas being thrown around
but I doubt we can do all of them for 5.0
hrmrmrm
colin doesn't have access to this room
But Colin and Kevin would be the ones to take point on that
S3 might be overkill, I wonder if the generator has any way of knowing where the user downloaded the file
and if we could just pass that back to the dashboard
but that might not be possible
oh
could the dashboard
pass in the filepath of the workspace
to the generator
so that when the user chooses to download the file
the default location could be the workspace
is that possible?
I guess that doesn't help cause we need to unzip it still
hrmrmrm
Hmmmm
Hmm
@superkev you have some solid ideas, maybe experiment with a few and see which one provides the best flow
@MatB I'll take a look after the rollout and AMA
I'm fine with making this room public fyi
@superkev the static files are in manhattan/build/misc/static
yeah
we should be
As long as varnish adheres to the key header if it sees it by default, then we don't have to do anything in the vcl I don't think
@JajaB yes, we can't remove any of those folders yet
oh, sure, I can do that
actually
@G3 can you edit the config in nosaka_build_scripts so that the staging config uses the same path as the prod config?
@G3 can you deploy it to staging?
lol
yeah, I'm working on that now
actually
@G3 could you take over
Cool, thanks
Oh god
What's up?
In a meeting?
Is our infra exploding?
Should I look for a new job MN
?
Pretty much :p
With?
That would be awesome
Could you kick off the builds?
Lol, no worries, you're a much welcomed distraction :p
Yea
back
what's up?
@JajaB back from meeting
okie dokie
I see a lot of jenkins emails
should I be concerned?
okie dokie
I adorbs
I like the husky corgi
^.^
@MatB no, that was stripped out I believe
feel free to remove
ah, yes, ruby magic
that's a moov compile failure
means something is wrong with the SDK
@MatB my obscure legacy code question is tingling, what's up?
"why on earth would it add '--account moovweb'?
yep, but I think we can remove it now
have to double check
but it should be fine.
: p
5.0.43
We'll prolly want to update that
--account=moovweb can probably be removed now since the build box is on 5.0
I have no idea what you guys are talking about with regards to the asset URL since I came into this conversation late
oh
is this on moov deploy or git push?
I see, lemme take a quick looksy
Is there a way to see what arguments were sent to the Build scripts?
that would help narrow down this issue
ah
==:  DEBUG : == ARG:  ajoshi/tofu4
Yeah, that line should be the site id and endpoing id
at least that's what hte build box is expecting
okie dokie
yes
if you can do it, please go ahead
I don't think I can, we need someone with admin access juan or lv
@juan
LAME
bai
@Aaron should be fixed
I've been summoned
it's not working
I rolled back the BB
and my apollo staging version of my project is 275
but my headers on the project say 271
everything looks fine on the logs
I SSHed into the build box
and everything is fine there
routing_manifest is updated
slugs are updated
all is good
MPS just ain't picking it up
I even checked the version on the slug file itself, in case we were building the slug incorrectly
MPS is being a douche
@pizza how's the testing going?
k
weeeeird
@MatB very weird
I see why
k
nice
going
done
please test
There's been a pivotal filed in October for that: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/58208318
@MatB (content)
@superkev I'm trying to run guap locally but I"m getting this error
Sass: : SyntaxError - File to import not found or unreadable:  moovui/moovui.\n
how i can fix?
@cneale maybe you know?
ah
submodules!
*shakes fist*
you guys should add that to the readme
nope
cool, thankee
woops
there
Is 8 workers too much? I figured it wouldn't be too bad...but I have no idea
Hmm, probably should reduce the number of workers to 4 maybe
8 might be too aggressive
2 to 4 on a rails app
but this is sinatra
theoretically lighter weight
so 4 should be solid
if 4 is the upper bound for rails
it should be a safe bound for sinatra
you wanna try 8 out?
no idea how to add those :P
But could give it a go
where can I release this to test?
guap.heroku.com?
staging would be good for now
who has access to push to staging?
Can one of you guys push to staging?
also, is the heroku configuration for staging and prod the same? like, same number of dynos, etc..?
ah
Hmm
could we push whatever is in staging to prod? or are there other major changes in place that would fuck with things?
cool, let's do it!
RAW
R
RAWR
woot
and the fire
can't wait to remove the fire as well
no
in cool kid code, being on fire is the new fetch
nice
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
so schrodienger
I'm here
At the bow and arrow that is
oh
we should change that message
Instead of git server it should say build server
@cneale @MatB should I make a pivotal to update that?
@cneale should I assign it to you?
what do you mean made that message up?
I thought that message was hard coded in apollo
didn't know it was something Sean had to input
Should I just kill the pivotal issue I just made then?
ah
so I'm leaving the ticket there :p
what's wrong with it?
oh
snapple
@superkev did you check in something in manhattan master?
what error message?
yeah
that's from the BB
we show that if host registration API call failed
no
we don't get that info from apollo
we just know that there was an error
(as far as I remember)
sounds good
(rdsalute)
cool
do we need to update the paths in circe as well?
noice
excellent, thanks guys
@m did you pull the FAQ off of the docs? I don't see any links to it anywhere anymore
ah
I found it on featured docs
but it doesn't seem to be anywhere else...I could've sworn there was a top-nav item for it...or maybe I"m going crazy
ah
I see it now
thanks
I'm going through and fixing the issues I found on thursday
cool (content)
yeah, I saw the ones you fixed, I think we're doing fine.
my pleasure =)
ugh, confluence is terrible for collaborative editing
can we collaborate on this on a google doc and then transfer to confluence once it's done?
weird
I didn't get an email about that
I'm adding it to the email thread for knowledge transfer :p
sorry I missed this...my phone did not ping me in the hipchat app =(
no plans
@G3 https://code.google.com/p/gcfg/  I guess it's not a standard library, this is the one I found.  The standard is called an INI config file.
Worth looking into but the decision on what to use should be discussed further
INI is the format, the extension could be anything
@MatB @cneale @w @pizza oh, fuck it, @all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq7G-Q9ZwC0
hrmrmrm, this first episode doesn't have much cooking
@cneale +10
np, that worked out pretty well actually
to skip the proxy?
that's possible, but probably unsustainable?
if they work on several projects that is
true
true
mlocal.* would be better if that works
