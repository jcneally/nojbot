Hello there, welcome to my site! My name is Manoj Dayaram, and I'm probably writing software for moovweb right now.
If you came here to find out what I like, well then, I like fire, fruit parfaits, hugs, tea, computer science education, pocket watches, puppies, kittens, ponies, top hats, monocles, half-belts, nail art, gloves, alpacas, grilled cheese, port, moscato, chartreuse, b&b, magic, and drawing. If you know I like something that's not on this list, then I probably either missed it, or I lied to you.
I will occasionally write random musings about life and such whenever I get the time or have a good idea. It's mostly brain dump for me, but perhaps it is of interest to you.
Unfortunately, there's not much else here, but if you'd like to find out more about me, you can always get in touch with me through other channels.
Still looking for more? Well, here's a picture of Beowulf ripping Grendel's arm off.
And that's that...
Most of the things I have are things people have given me throughout the years.  During the winter break, I’ve been trying to clean my room and I have stumbled through several items which I remember being a keepsake from someone, though I can’t quite remember from who or exactly the context that it was given to me in.

This made me wonder a few things…when does a keepsake stop being a keepsake?  Is it when it no longer reminds you of the person that gave it to you or the event where you stumbled upon it?  Or does it ever stop being one?  Does the item itself lose value as your memory of it’s beginnings fade?  Did it ever have any value other than it’s trigger to that memory?  If it’s a functional keepsake, does it lose all its value once it’s no longer functional?

People usually get the impression that I really like Halloween for some reason.  Not sure if it’s just because of my ridiculous nature or the random antics I pull from time to time that perhaps, when extrapolated, can be loosely related to the mischief which is associated with Halloween.  Regardless why it may be, when it comes close to Halloween time, friends always seem to have relatively high hopes and expectations in seeing what I’ll do, in terms of costume or anything event related.

It’s not really disappointment, but mostly a look of confusion that I get when I tell them that I’m actually not that into Halloween other than just really liking The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I don’t really like dressing in costume, and when you take that away, Halloween is mostly just a good reason to have fun in whatever way you want, which is what I try to do all the time anyways. 

However, this has been an exciting year of changes and revelations.  For this reason, I wanted to give Halloween a serious try.  I got super excited about our company party, but most importantly of all, I really wanted an awesome costume.

After a while of contemplating, and going through highs and lows of wanting a full body fox costume and realizing how hard it would be to find one my size, I was falling back into my old habit of “let me just wear my old rave clothes and call that a costume.”

I tried going back in my mind to previous Halloweens and thinking of any cool costumes I remembered.  Most I quickly brushed off assuming that they just wouldn’t work for me.  Finally, I remembered a costume my friend Dat had last year.  He was a Pinterest board - in other words, had several pictures pinned on his shirt.

I remember really liking his costume, but I didn’t quite understand why at the time, but it hit me now: interactivity.  It wasn’t just a costume you’d look at and admire, but rather, the viewer could participate.  They could add their own photo to his shirt.

I now had a new goal: an interactive costume.  I’d like to say that it took me a really long time to come up with the idea from here, but I was in a point in my life where this concept resonated with me so strongly that it came to me immediately: I would be a personification of Post Secret.

For those of you who don’t know what Post Secret is, it is “an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard” which are then posted on the website.  I was actually really surprise to find out how many people didn’t know about it, but it just made me that much happier to meet someone that got it right away.

So what does that mean in terms of a costume?  I decided to wear mostly black and carry fabric markers with me asking people to write their secrets or confessions onto my clothes.  I quickly bought some pants and a shirt from a thrift shop as well as suspenders and a tie.  I decided to use my fedora as a sign post to give people a clue as to what I was.  My costume was complete, or rather, more like "ready."

Since Halloween fell on a Thursday this year, there were parties and events going on both the weekend prior and the weekend after.  I decided to wear my costume on Friday and Saturday night on the prior week, as well as Thursday all day.  I walked around the streets, asking not just my friends and acquaintances, but strangers, baristas at coffee shops, waiters, drivers, and anyone that seemed even mildly interested if they’d like to post a secret on me.  Though sometimes impossible, I tried my best to keep the person’s identity anonymous to myself, and made sure to not survey what was written on me until the very end.

Though I really loved the idea of the costume, my expectations were very low.  You can’t really stop people from simply using you as a human blackboard where they’d write on me any nonsensical thing.  And though there was a fair share of people that drew penises or left their phone numbers, I was really impressed and touched at some of the secrets people left.

I’m afraid my demons will win.

Men have wounded me.  It’s scary.

Here is a couple written over each other:

For 3 years I had to fake it w/ my ex.

I’m having a good time.  It’s weird.

This one is hard to read, as it’s been overpowered by other messages on top of it, but it’s still somewhat decipherable if you look closely:

I make jokes b/c I have no reason to laugh.

I’m secretly a sad person.

And so many more…honestly, I started this project hoping to provide people a safe space for expressing things they have been holding on to, but I never realized the impact it would affect me.  Coming home at the end of the day on Halloween night and taking a look at some of the messages written on me, nearly all for the first time, actually made me tear up.  It was a true reminder that we’re all more than what we make ourselves seem.

Thank you to everyone who shared a secret with me.  I really appreciate you sharing a little vulnerable part of yourselves.

Today was the first day of Outside Lands.  Between all the stages, there was this one section in the middle of the woods called “Digital Detox: Disconnect to Reconnect.”  It was basically an area where they kindly asked you to turn off your phones and had a bunch of really cool old retro type of stuff.

There were rotary phones, chalkboards, crayons, board games, tea rooms…and a typewriter.  I’ve had “We Belong" stuck in my head recently, so I typed up a lyric from it on the top of an index card.  I then promptly folded it up and kept it in my wallet.

When I got home I found the card again while clearing out my pockets.  After looking at it for a while, I just couldn’t help the urge to illustrate it.  I actually spent quite a bit of time on this one, but I love how it turned out.  It’s probably one of my favorites.

My company came up with this new marketing term called a t.Engine.  The current logo is still a work in progress, but there was a joking consensus that it looked like a meat grinder.  Ike, the marketer who came up with the logo, challenged us to do better.

Thus, I present to you my rendition of a t.Engine!  In traditional start-up napkin canvas =D

Was waiting in the doctor’s office so I decided to put up a sketch.  Supposed to be a person sitting on a hill, overlooking the plains, large tree on the corner, tiny child flying a kite on the plains, mountains over the horizon.

The circle in the middle of the page was going to be a magnifying glass peeking into the world of a tiny ant, either carrying a leaf or walking along a blade of grass.  Unfortunately, I got called in before I could get started on that.

Me and Molly went to Dandelion Chocolate today.  The place has some pretty cool and intricate architecture.  This is my inaccurate representation of their roof from where I was sitting.

I’m not sure what happened here.  This is one of those drawings where I just tried drawing stuff out of no where.

I don’t like it.  Let’s forget it ever happened.

"I hadn’t been to a 7-11 for the longest time, and as I passed by one today on my way to work, I decided to stop by and check it out. I remember liking their coffee a lot, so I went straight to the coffee bar. As I poured myself a cup, the guy next to me accidentally spilled coffee everywhere.

He was a very stoic fellow. Very serious looking, expressionless. He wore a very interesting black hat.

Anyways, seeing the spill, I started helping him out. I took a bunch of napkins and gave him some. We both began cleaning vigorously. His expression unchanging the entire time. Not saying a word.

Once we were done he left to pay for his coffee. I still had to finish setting up mine, but as I walked to the cashier, she told me that the guy with the hat paid for my coffee. I quickly rushed out the door to look for him, but he was gone.

Thanks stoic hat guy, you made my day feel better!”

I was meaning to make a blog post about this but decided to write it as a story for sftruestoryproject.tumblr.com

I remember the coffee tasting terrible, but I couldn’t help but smile almost the entire day.  The little things truly have a huge impact.

But oh man, my handwriting…that’s pretty horrible.

Molly took over again with a really beautiful sketch of a shepherd girl.  As you can tell, her drawing style is very animeish.

So I got a Sketch Doodle kit from Yvonne which comes with a bunch of sketch doodle ideas.  The first one was “Aardvark.”  They show you the picture of a very cartoony aardvark and then have instructions on how you can draw it.  I really liked the inspiration since one of my biggest problems is just thinking of things to draw, but I didn’t like the instruction set on how to draw an aardvark, so I just went ahead and drew one from random pictures I found on the internet of real aardvarks.

I’m not too much of a fan on how it came out.  I finished drawing him and was disappointed.  Molly suggested I draw him play cards, so I gave him a hand of cards.  Then I thought it looked somewhat boring so I added a rabbit eating his cards, and the rabbit made me think of Alice in Wonderland and pocket watches, so I draw that with a secret Ace.

Overall a very random sketch.

We’re all imperfect.  That is not a surprise.  It’s something you hear everyone saying, “everyone has flaws, just gotta learn to accept them.”  Acceptance, it seems, is the way to deal with your imperfections.  You are imperfect  and that’s ok, so you should learn to accept your imperfections and be happy with yourself.

For the longest time, I had idolized this thought.  I took a close look at myself and pinned all the things I thought were terrible about me.  And what did I do?  I accepted them.  I took them in as part of me.  I joked about them, I talked about them freely, I let people know about them up front, I made them part of my personality.  I had ingrained my imperfections into myself so much so that my friends or colleagues didn’t even see them as such anymore, but rather, as just being me.

A great example of this is my sleeping habits.  I have terrible sleeping habits.  I go to sleep late, and wake up early.  When I do sleep, I sleep terribly, always waking up in the middle of the night, kicking, moving, whatever.  Every now and then I’ll get so terribly tired that I’ll crash and finally get a good night’s sleep, but I’ll be lucky to get those once a week.

So what did I do?  I owned it.  People are aware of my sleeping habits, I joke about it openly.  I’ve actually won the “Vampire” award at my company for being the most active during the night hours.  Whenever I go out I’m always willing to stay late because I know that if I came home, it’s not like I would be able to sleep, so might as well keep going.  Drink some tea or coffee at night? Sure, why not, it’s not like it would’ve made a difference either way.

After a while, not sleeping, as well as several other flaws/imperfections, felt like a part of me.  Or rather, I found myself thinking that what made me interesting as a person were my imperfections.  Perfect people are boring, I would think to myself.  I’m interesting and unique because of my flaws.  They became a topic of conversation, a way to engage people, or even an ice breaker.

All of a sudden I started idolizing my flaws.  I thought it was awesome that I couldn’t sleep, or rather, that I didn’t “need” sleep to function.  I stopped seeing it as a flaw and more as an attribute of what made me me.  I am the guy that rarely sleeps.  Isn’t that awesome?  It’s like a super power!  Insomniaman!

I tricked myself into making my flaws something positive.  It’s actually surprisingly easy to do.  I’m not indicisive, I just value the needs of others more and want their needs to be met.  I’m not terrible at time management, I just really care about my work and really want to get everything done.  

You can probably see how this can turn awry.

I very quickly became attached to my imperfections. I could try to improve any one of them, but that would be like giving up a part of myself.  What am I if not the bummed knee insomniac who would rather have someone else decide the music list for the night?  Who am I?  Will I still be an interesting person?  How could I be?

As you can tell, this lead to a mini identity crisis.  After much reflection, you kind of realize that the above is just not sustainable.  Sure, being purposely damaged and imperfect may offer me some level of allure to the general public, but compounded they’ve become a huge hazard for both my physical and mental health.  Not only that, but I almost felt childish, as in, I can’t believe that after all these years I still have these same problems. As my 13 year old self, I would’ve never fathom that my sleeping habits would’ve persisted over a decade later.  It felt embarrassing, as if I had made no progress in life.

From that revelation, the rest kind of just fell into place.  Our imperfections don’t make us who we are, they are transient attributes that will come and go throughout our life.  Holding to any particular one of them is selfish and preventing the real you from growing.

So I took a major turn, and for the past couple of years have been trying very hard to improve upon myself.  I’ve had some successes and also a lot of failures, but from anything you can derive useful information.  In the case of sleep, I read several books on the subject, tried several combinations of routines and even got a sleep-quality tracker.  After a while of experimenting, I finally found a routine that worked for me.  Though my sleeping habits are still quite in flux, I at least now know what to do in order to stabilze them when I really need to.  It’s unfortunately not always possible given everything else going on in my life, but I have at least made strides towards eventual sleep nirvana.

My attitude when speaking to people regarding my flaws has also changed.  If I speak about them at all, I’m no longer boastful, but rather, inquisitive for any advice they may have for trying to overcome them.

Do I miss being the damaged guy with imperfections?  Sometimes.  It’s hard to get rid of that feeling entirely, but I’m sure I’ll be at peace with it at some point.  I guess part of it is internalizing that, though someone that’s damaged may be interesting, someone who was able to overcome their damage is even more so.

Molly stole my sketchbook and drew her own little entry of a fairy.  As you can see, her drawing style far differs from mine, in the sense that hers is a lot better.  

We saw this beautiful sunset on the cruise, the horizon was flooded with really thick gray clouds, and you could barely see the sun just below it, on the horizon line, and slightly above.  The clouds had a sharp stop, leading up to a really gorgeous gradient sky.

My depiction is pretty terrible unfortunately.

Just swam with dolphins, so I drew one!  But, I didn’t like the way it turned out.  I didn’t want to erase it, so I just drew a cool looking octopus next to it.

He lost his two legs in the Great Ocean War.

I’m not sure what I was doing here.  I started off with a giant ball, and thought it would be funny to draw a dinosaur on it, so it was like, a dinosaur riding an asteroid, reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove.

But then I drew some guys playing ping pong with it, and…some crazy dude in the corner, I don’t know.  First experiment in mental drawing.

Raining Rainbow!

Me and Molly have been wanting to put up some paintings on our walls, so I recently bought a watercolor set and we started some practice paintings.  I drew/painted this jelly fish.  Could be better, but it’s a nice start.  Helped me learn a decent amount on how to control watercolor stuff.  Note to self, never try to color white on top of another color.

Went to Angel Island for a company trip.  One of my co-workers brought his 3 year old daughter.  I asked her what I I should draw, and she said a ballerina.  

I hate umbrellas.  Why do I hate them?  Well, they don’t shield you from rain coming in from an angle, they fail at shielding you from splashes coming from below, they poke people’s eyes out, they are completely useless in the wind, making you look ridiculous, and more often than not, end up getting destroyed after a rainy and windy day, making them a terrible solution for the problem they’re attempting to solve, which is not getting wet in the rain.

It’s easy to say that you like or dislike something if your reasonings are purely logical.  I like or dislike this because of reasons x, y z.  You make a logical argument in your brain as to why something is good or not and convince yourself of it.  It’s not important whether that argument is correct or not, what matters is that you are convinced that it is.

Can we really call liking, or disliking, as described above, an emotion?  Something that is construed from logical statements, as such, seems somewhat odd to call a feeling, yet most people use it in that manner.  I really like pocket watches.  I would go as far to say that I love pocket watches.  What do I love about them?  Well, it lets me check the time while I’m on my phone, they don’t constrict my wrist like a normal watch would, and I like the attention I get from people when they notice it.  You could delve further into the psychological implications of the last statement, but if you only really care about my emotional attachment to pocket watches, then the buck stops there.  

But why does the buck stop there?  Why do I like the attention people give me when they notice my pocket watch? — I’ve sat here for five minutes trying to think of a good reason and can’t come up with any.  At this point, I can very comfortably say that I like that feeling, simply because it is what I like, and that is that.  Again, you can delve into the topic psychologically, perhaps I didn’t get enough attention as a child and feel like I have to compensate, or I got too much and I need to keep up the rhythm.  However, at this stage, why I feel the way I feel is of no concern to me, but the fact that attention from people illicits that feeling is what matters.  That is true emotion, and everything else that leads up to it (such as the pocket watch itself) is merely a tool to get there.

So why do we like, or dislike certain things?  Why do we really like certain sounds, tastes, and feelings? Why do we like, or even love certain people?  Could you accurately describe the reasons why you like your significant other?

I’m no biochemist, but at this point, I feel like that is the domain we enter through.  For some reason or another, the stimuli that you adore or hate is causing some kind of chemical reaction to take place in your brain, perhaps your entire body.  Whatever reactions take place will dictate whether you feel good or bad about whatever just happened, and after enough times of it happening, you will develop some sense of like or dislike towards the given stimuli.*

So what does that say about our different likes and dislikes?  Is your love for chocolate equated to simply the chemicals that are released after you eat it?  Is your love for a person equated to simply the chemical reactions that take place in your brain when you’re around them?  One interesting thing that I’d like to propose is that regardless of what the equation is, you could almost always take the stimuli out of the picture and still be able to sustain the same feeling through other means.  In other words, it’s almost as if you have a choice of what you get to like and dislike as long as you are able to manipulate the chemical reactions happening in your brain, or at least trick your brain into thinking something is interesting enough times to develop a liking to it.

An obvious way of doing this would be through drugs.  Molly will very easily make you love everything and everyone.  A more sustainable approach, though, is consciously taking a deep interest in everything you encounter, and avoid dismissing things simply by what may seem as their boring surface.  I’m a firm believer that everything and everyone is interesting as long as you’re willing to dig deep into the people or subject matters.

So where does that leave us?  Suppose you do a pretty decent job at employing the above technique.  You become very open to new experiences without judgement, and have amassed a generally diverse collection of friends as you try your best not to dismiss anyone simply because they may seem uninteresting at first.  You become the person that’s always up for anything, no matter how ridiculous, and you always have a blast while doing things.

So what’s wrong with the picture above?  At first glance, nothing.  In fact, I’ve lived the majority of my life not seeing anything wrong with this picture.  The problem actually comes up when the technique is employed.  Rationally, you would only employ it when you’re doing things beyond your control, or perhaps if you’re trying new things voluntarily.  But what happens if that becomes your default way of thinking when experiencing new things and meeting new people?  Well, you pretty much end up liking everything you do, and everyone you meet.

Don’t see the problem yet?  The easiest way to bring it about is by asking a simple question:  What’s your favorite song?  Got an answer?  Then you probably don’t have this problem.  There’s just too many songs, and I like all of them.  Do you have a favorite restaurant?  They’re all great and delicious, I don’t know which one to pick.  This “disorder” of sorts surfaces up as simple indecisiveness, however, it can get slightly more complicated when you involve other people in the equation.  Do you like Amy?  Do you like her because of the technique you employed above, or do you truly like her?  Is there a difference?  Are you justified in dating Amy if you don’t like her any more than you like Becky, Carol, or any other girl for that matter?

If you become too comfortable with the technique, the problem also manifests itself when you’re given too much freedom.  So you have a long break coming up?  What are you going to do?  You could do absolutely anything.  What would you like to do?  I don’t know, there’s just too many things that are interesting, I can’t really choose.  So what happens?  You end up doing nothing.  You know that whatever you end up doing you’ll enjoy, so why bother doing anything?  

Perhaps the above may not seem like a problem to most people.  It’s actually a nice way to stay economical; you don’t have to spend money on any extravagant vacation plans or items.  Some might even say that it makes you easily amused, which in general, I consider to be a more positive characteristic than anything.  But it also means that you’re doing nothing, and thus, are making zero progress on anything.  Maybe that’s fine for some people, but for me, it makes me feel very uneasy.  

So what’s the solution then?  Just pick something and go?  But how do you know that you picked the “right” thing?  You like everything else just as much as whatever you picked, so how can you, in all good conscious, decide to do one thing over another?  Well, maybe you’ll just know.  Maybe there’s that one thing that’ll come around, say art, where you simply thoroughly enjoy.  You find yourself enthralled by it with little to no effort, and just like that, you found your niche.  But what if you haven’t found it yet?  Or worse, what if everything you’ve tried thus far gives you that feeling.  Then what?  What do you do?  Given infinite time, perhaps you could actually become involved in everything, but you don’t, so what do you save you’re precious time for?

Well, certainly not umbrellas, that’s for sure.

* Again, I’m not biochemist, so all of this is pure contemplation on my part.  I’d be totally excited about talking to a real biochemist about this though, so if you’re one, and you’d like to chat, drop me an email.


Was walking home from work where I decided to stop by a park and just chill for a bit.  There were a ton of birds flapping and chilling around, so I figured I’d give my hand at drawing one.  They all moved around way too much, so this sketch is the result of observing several different types of birds in several different positions.

On our flight to Vegas for EDC, figured I’d get a sketch in there.  Albert was sitting totally still reading his iPad for a decently long time.  In the middle of the sketch, he actually completely shifted and stretched all around…and then got right back into the same exact position, woot!

This is Daisy, one of Molly and Larry’s bearded dragons.  I started drawing her while she was laying on the log as depicted here, but then the bigger bearded dragon, Derek, pushed her off before I could finish my sketch, so I kind of improvised most of her body’s lower half.  Oh well, didn’t turn out terribly I suppose.

I’m going to Vegas on June 8th for EDC.  I was there last year and it was a lot of fun.  This year, I’m even meeting a few friends from high school that I haven’t seen in forever.  I’m pretty excited to catch up and party with them.

This is actually an anomaly.  I don’t usually travel for events like this.  I hate being on a plane, but concede that it is the best way to travel long distances.  I’m not much of a sight seer, and I hate tourism, crowded areas, and tourist attractions.  However, I find myself traveling a lot, specially to the East coast.  

So why do I travel then?  For me, it’s a very simple motivator:  To see people that I otherwise would not be able to see.  The dispersion of college and high school has helped me accumulate friends in many different places.  Unfortunately, I’m not that good in staying in touch by other means, such as email, Facebook, texts, and the like.  Thus, I opt for the more extreme approach, seeing them in person whenever I can.  From my lens, the sole purpose of going on a trip is to see one or more people and spend as much time as possible with them.  

One thing that I have noticed quite often is people’s desire to want to meet up at different locations.  Usually I’ll be casually talking about my future planned trips when people will chime in saying that our itineraries intersect, and that we should venture forth together into the night sky of a new city conquered by our ridiculosity.  

As much fun as the proposal sounds, I almost always reject the new venture.  What surprises me the most though is how hurt people seem to be by my rejection.  Almost as if it was a personal attack of me not enjoying their company even though I’m in the middle of doing just that.  Once I’m aware of how hurt people get, I find myself having to explain my motivations for travelling, and how I’d rather spend my limited time seeing the people that I don’t usually get to see.  Though my explanation helps provide reasoning behind my rejection, I can’t really do much about their disappointment.  

I understand where they’re coming from though.  Enjoying experiences with others in new locations is a great and easy way to cement relationships.  It puts you in a position where it’s “us against the world” which is hard not to bond over.  

So what is the best outcome in this situation?  I don’t want to lose the opportunity to create tighter bonds with the people I interact with daily, but I also would like to spend as much time as possible with the friends that I long to see. 

I’ve recently been thinking of trying a hybrid approach, were you perhaps join social groups and give a try at hanging out together.  My past attempts at this have failed as one side of the group quickly indulges in past nostalgia, neglecting the outsider and making him/her feel uncomfortable as they don’t know what people are talking about and also can’t contribute to the conversation.  

My hopeful solution for now is to simply be more attentive of the situation and try to make sure everyone is engaged and can contribute.  However, there’s still a lot that I need to learn about juggling these two sides.  What is the best outcome when combining these two situations?  Is everyone actually benefiting from this compromise?  Or am I merely cheating both sides from their respective time?

Well, you can tell you fail at life when you get a sketch-a-day notebook, decide that’s too hard so you relax the condition to sketch-a-week, and *still* can’t get that going….

Anyways, this one is a quick sketch I did of Karen while we were driving to/from/during Monterey.  I used my rainbow color pencil which is why all the colors are kind of blending with each other.

Tried to get a sketch in during Edwin’s birthday bash in Tahoe.  We did a wine tasting, so I started drawing the kitchen counter which had some left over glasses of wine.  Unfortunately, I got distracted with partying and I stopped half way.  By the time I came back to my drawing, someone had cleaned up the counter =(

Went to a dog park so I gave a try at drawing some of the dogs.  Unfortunately they moved way too fast, so I couldn’t get any good drawings in.  Alas, my memory, it fails me.

I was waiting at Starbucks for Lee to show up, so I decided to put on a sketch.  I really wanted to try my rainbow color pencil, and figured, what better subject to do that with than Rainbow Dash?  None, there’s no better subject.

Sketch-a-day #2, Homer, my ten year old puppy, laying down in what I can only imagine is the most awkward but comfortable position.

I’m starting a sketch-a-day journal.  It’s only been like four days and I already fell off the bandwagon with only two sketches, which is fine.  As long as I can go at least a sketch a week, I feel accomplished.

I drew this while I was bumming around in Central Park.  I looked around for things to draw and was feeling pretty meh about everything, so I started digging through the pictures on my phone and found this pic of James at Starbucks, and the rest is terrible drawing history.

Every now and then, I like to go to a barber to remind myself what a good old fashion shave feels like.  And every now and then, the barber tries to give me the closest shave possible.

Sometimes I warn the guy telling him that I have sensitive skin, so he should probably just shave with the grain. Other times, the barber figures this out himself and concedes the perfect shave in order to spare me bloodshed. 

However, sometimes the barber seems so confident that I think to myself, maybe this guy is good enough to not cut me on pursuit of a smooth face. Maybe this is the barber I’ve been looking for, maybe he’s the one who can save me from this eternal curse of a sandpaper chin. Certainly he has dealt with people like me before, he must already have everything worked out. Maybe I could learn I thing or two from him.

So I refrain, I refrain from saying anything, and let the pro do his job, me just sitting quietly with my eyes closed enjoying the hot towel on my face.

Invariable, it begins. 

"Shit" - not a word you want to hear from someone handling a sharp knife around your neck. "Fuck" "Shoot", it goes on, starting at my neck, through my chin, around my lips, everywhere. I feel every nick, every cut, perfectly synchronized with a curse. 

My reward? A face covered in blood. Alas, another dud. At least my face is super smooth…well, for today anyways.

Walking relatively fast towards the caltrain station, met a fellow fast paced walker. At first we kept pretty good pace with each other, but then we hit a barrier. A group of middle aged ladies came out of Whole Foods and walked slowly in front of us, they took up the entire sidewalk. Not being in a rush, I adjusted my pace accordingly, however, my fellow fast-pacer could not stand for such bottleneck.

It was funny seeing her trying to skip the group in front of us.  Methods such as diverting to the street and leaping them were met with new blocks from fire hydrants, trees, and cars.  After all her failed attempts, she just gave up and joined me at the back of the group at a slow pace.  

Once the group took a turn, we both got back into fast paced mode, but she gradually started slowing down, and I completely overtook her.  Goodbye fellow fast pacer, I hope you’re not late to wherever it is you’re going.  But if you just like walking fast like me, then I hope you enjoyed your walk =)

Survival of the Fittest
The Expressiveness of Computer Languages

I come from a very heavy Java background.  I’ve worked with Java for almost 10 years now, and I’ve worked with very large Java code bases in my previous jobs.  Needless to say, I was a huge design pattern nut.

For those of you who are not familiar, a design pattern is a generalized solution for a recurring problem within software engineering, mostly in the domain of source code organization and interactions.  The Gang of Four book is considered to be the bible of design patterns for Object Oriented Design, and it quickly became my obsession.  Whenever I encountered an architectural problem I couldn’t quite figure out how to solve (or even if I did figure out a solution, but wondered if there was a better one), that was the book I would turn to.

Design patterns ruled my coding life, and I aimed to understand as many as I could.  I love thinking about abstract problems.  I love thinking about software architecture: how different modules communicate with each other, how different parts of code interact with one another, and how to achieve maximum code clarity and self-documentation.  At the time, design patterns seemed like the best way to achieve that.

However, as time went on, and the more design patterns I encountered and implemented, something strange started happening…I started to hate coding.  I wasn’t exactly sure why, but for some reason I felt unfulfilled, aggravated, and frustrated whenever I actually needed to sit down and make something happen.  I still held my love for solving problems in an elegant fashion, figuring out the best way to organize modules in order to decrease coupling and increase code cohesion, however, I began to accept it as a fact that coding brilliant solutions was tedious and boring.  Not only that, I had began doubting whether all brilliant solutions could always be expressed in a clear self-documenting way in code.  Though design patterns offered a venue on how to organize code in such a way that modules were loosely coupled but cohesive, they actually left the source code looking klunky, confusing, and incomprehensible — unless you were already familiar with the design patterns used.

Though not as extensively as Java, I have worked with many other languages before.  At this point in my life I started yearning for the days when I used to work in SML due to how structured and clean my code had felt even though I was tackling rather complicated problems.  I missed my Functors, my Signatures and Modules, my Option Types and functions as first class citizens.  However, SML had always felt like a toy, mostly because of its grave performance, leaving its main purpose as an educational tool more so than anything else.

And such was life.  I eventually left my old job and found myself working here at Moovweb.  The language of choice?  Go.  Hmm, interesting, never heard of it.  It seemed like some weird chimera of Python and C with the concurrency constructs of SML.  Quite fascinating indeed, but it was just another language, nothing to get hyped over.  And so, I churned away and learned as much as I could about it as I began using it to code on my day to day.

As time went on, though, something interesting had happened…I started to enjoy coding again.  I actually found it fun to code solutions in Go.  It was ridiculously refreshing how easily the language allowed you to express complicated ideas.  It turned what once felt like a chore into a wonderful experience once again.  There was no boilerplate, no magic, no tricks; the code was always clear, self explanatory, concise, and clean.  That’s when it had dawned on me…

Design patterns exist to compensate for a programming language’s lack of expressiveness.

I remember feeling super proud of myself for coming up with this idea.  I walked around the halls with a huge smirk on my face, giving high fives to people, finger guns ablazing.

Little did I know that this revelation had been an item of much discussion for nearly ten years now within the Computer Science community.  Jeff Atwood from Coding Horror compiled a nice blog post about how design patterns might be how languages evolve back in 2005 where he quotes a wiki entry from Cunningham & Cunningham about how the presence of excessive design patterns is indicative of missing language features.

Though suddenly dulled of my triumph of coming up with something new and novel, I had at least gained a new confidence that the thought had merit and became increasingly interested in the idea of design patterns as language features.  As mentioned in Jeff Atwood’s post linked above, Peter Norvig had found that 16 of the 23 design patterns described in the Gang of Four book were invisible or simpler in the Lisp programming language.

But Lisp is a very old programming language.  If design patterns is indeed how languages evolve, then shouldn’t we have languages today that are way more expressive than Lisp?  Instead, languages such as C++ and Java came up and overtook the industry.   I guess like Darwinian evolution, we most certainly expect some unfavorable mutations to take place, we can only learn through experimentation and failure after all.

And boy do we experiment!  There are currently over 600 programming languages out there.  Some are mild variations of others, some are testing out completely new and different paradigms, and some are just good for a laugh…but why are languages such as Java and C++ still in such heavy use when it’s been shown that they lack expressiveness?  Shouldn’t they have been weeded out in the survival of the fittest, leaving only the most expressive languages around for common usage?

Well, in a world where novelty is appreciated, it seems more plausible that we would deal with certain inconveniences in order to say that we’re working with something novel.  Java and C++ were novel at the time they were created because Object Oriented Design was novel.  In fact, I would argue that most languages that gain any traction are languages that are based on a novel concept, a new paradigm, or a new attempt at applying expressiveness.

What does this mean for our evolution process?  Suddenly our definition of “fittest” is no longer how expressive a language is, but rather, how novel it is.  This would explain how platforms such as NodeJS are gaining traction, likewise Ruby’s reintroduction to popularity on the appearance of the novel Rails framework1.  After a while, the pattern becomes fairly clear:  When people start designing new programming languages or frameworks they’re not targeting expressiveness, they’re targeting novelty.

And that is why I love Go so much.  During its humble beginnings Go would get a lot of flak from the community because it didn’t introduce anything new or novel.  The language was “nothing special” people would say.  Rather than focusing on a new niche or novelty, the designers of the language focused on expressiveness, and it shows.  I was amazed at how an innocent-looking language feature such as embedding could be used to simplify a wealth of design patterns; Composite, Facade, Proxy, Bridge, and Adapter2.  Not only that, but channels, range, slices, and a wealth of other little language features come into your aid when implementing all sorts of different design patterns.  None of these features are new or novel, they’ve existed in many languages prior, yet you don’t usually see them all combined in one language with such synergy as they are in Go.

Go still adheres to the same laws of evolution as all its other language counterparts, but it’s betting that expressiveness (rather than novelty) should be used to define fitness.  It would’ve been a long shot a few years ago, but I think the Computer Science community is at a point where they’re ready for that change. As Go gains traction I hope that more debate centers around the concept of language expressiveness, hopefully leading to a world where the most expressive languages thrive.
